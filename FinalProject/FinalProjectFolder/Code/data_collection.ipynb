      "Content: First you are going to get castor seeds, the seeds are readily available through wholesale seed suppliers for about $20 for a pound of seeds. Castor bean seeds are very tough to crack or peel. Soak them for an hour in a solution of 2 tablespoons lye in 1 cup water. Then use pliers to crack the shell. The shell will peel of the bean readily then. Use a 1/2 cup of acetone to every ounce of bean pulp. Blend well. Let sit for several days with occasional shaking. Pour off the acetone and add an additional 1/2 cup of acetone and repeat. This will remove almost all the castor oil from the seeds. The patent doesn’t mention it, but you can use magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt) instead of sodium sulfate. Epsom salt is readily available in any drug store for just about a dollar a pound.Use a plastic membrane filter if you can get them. The ricin forms a layer that is difficult to remove from a regular coffee paper filter without scraping off fibers as well. 4.Wear a gas mask and gloves. Try to keep the ricin wet at all times to avoid generating any dust (DEADLY!). And always shower and change clothes after handling. 5.Preparation Ricin is a protoplasmic poison prepared from castor beans after the extraction of castor oil therefrom. It is most effective as a poison when injected intravenously or inhaled, the latter requiring extreme commutation and small particle size to be effective, It is believed that the toxic action is catalytic rather than stoichiometric which probably accounts for the high toxicity of the agent. Because of its relative instability ricin must be handled with extreme care. In neutral aqueous solution it is stable only up to 60″-75″C., and in solid form up to 100″- 110 C., although for short exposures, temperatures up to 130may be tolerated. It is sensitive to acids, alkalis and halogens and may also be inactivated by mechanical working such as grinding or pulverizing. These factors are of great importance in developing a satisfactory method for preparing the material. Although ricin has been prepared in crystalline condition in the laboratory in small quantities, it becomes necessary, for purposes of toxicological warfare, to prepare relatively large quantities in a high state of purity. This necessitates that as much as possible of the non-toxic material present be removed in the process. In preparing the protein material, the castor beans are first ground and pressed to remove most of the oil. The pressed cake still retains about 15% oil and this may be removed by means of solvents which will extract an additional 150 pounds of oil per ton of beans and reduce the oil retained in the cake to a little over 1%. In the event that the expressing step is supplemented by solvent extraction, it is important to prevent detoxification of the protein during the solvent removal step. If residual solvent is removed from the ground beans by blowing with steam, considerable detoxification results. Blowing with nitrogen effectively prevents detoxification but is expensive when carried out on a large scale.After the oil has been removed, the pressed cake or pomace is extracted by agitating with water at a pH of 3.8+-0.1 at 25″ C. which removes substantially all of the toxic protein. The extraction process is operative within a pH range of about 3 to 4.5 although the preferred range is about 3.5 to 4. The optimum operating point is a pH of 3.8+-.1, as indicated above. A careful pH control is essential in order that as much non-toxic protein as possible may be eliminated and also that the filtration rate may be held at a satisfactory value. Either HCl or H2SO4 may be used to get the desired pH for the extraction water, but H2SO4 is preferred due to its lower corrosion rate and ease of handling in concentrated form. The acid should be used in reasonably dilute form to prevent undue local concentrations during its addition. A 5% concentration is satisfactory. Following the extraction, the slurry is filtered using either a conventional recessed plate filter or a continuous string discharge vacuum filter. With the latter about 7% of filter aid, based on meal weight, was found necessary for satisfactory filtration. The filtrate from the water extraction step, which contains the ricin, was treated with a 16.7% solution of Na2SO4 to precipitate the protein. This solution is composed of 20 pounds of salt in 100 pounds of water and the amount used was such that the salt content equaled 20% of the filtrate weight. This amount and concentration of salt solution was about optimum considering the factors of cost and toxin recovery. Somewhat higher concentrations and larger amounts of solution can be used, however. The precipitation process is not limited to the use of Na2SO4 since a saturated solution of NaCl can be used successfully, but Na2SO4 solution gives better nitrogen fractionation, more rapid precipitation, and can be operated under wider pH limits. It is desirable to raise the pH to about 7-8 before precipitation as this gives better recovery and greater non-toxic nitrogen removal. The pH was raised to this value by using NaOH or Na2CO3 the latter being preferred. The base used was quite dilute in order to prevent detoxification due to high local concentrations in the solution. A 5% solution of NaOH was used, whereas with Na2CO3 a 12% solution was preferred. In general, this higher pH during precipitation gave a greater non-toxic nitrogen fractionation and at the same time maintained the toxin loss at less than 2%. After precipitation, the slurry was filtered using from 1 to 4% filter aid, based on slurry weight, for satisfactory filtration, the amount of filter aid needed being dependent on the type of press used. Washing the filter cake with Na2SO4 solution removed additional non-toxic nitrogen which is desirable. In this washing step a 16.7% solution of Na2SO4 was again used. This washing step removed an additional 15% of non-toxic nitrogen from the cake. After filtration the filter cake which contains the ricin in combination with the Na2SO4 may be dried and slurried with CCl4 to separate the ricin by flotation. Separation of the ricin after a single precipitation and washing step is possible, but it is preferred to carry the process through an additional extraction and precipitation step. This is accomplished by slurrying the filter cake in three times its weight of water and the pH of the slurry is again brought to 3.8+-.1 by means of 5% H2SO4 The slurry is filtered and a second precipitation is brought about by adding Na2SO4 solution. Although pH control here is not wholly essential it is advantageous to bring the pH to approximate neutrality by adding 12% Na2CO3. A precipitation time of 45 minutes was necessary to obtain complete removal of the toxin. In filtering out the precipitate, no filter aid was used and the filter cake was washed with Na2S04 solution on the filter whereby an additional amount of non-toxic nitrogen was removed from the cake. This washing was effective only the first time and repeated washings had little effect in removing further non-toxic nitrogen. The ricin-Na2SO4 precipitate was dried at about 50″to 60″ C. on a hot air tray dryer. The dried product was ground to pass a 40 mesh screen and agitated with 5 times its weight of CCl4 which served the separate the ricin from the Na2SO4 by flotation. After settling. the ricin was skimmed off the top. This reduced the Na2SO4 content of the mixture from a previous 40 to 50% down to 15 to 18%. About 1 to 2% of nitrogen remained in the Na2SO4 salt which could then be used for subsequent precipitations. The final precipitation produced a particle size of 1-2 mu. On drying the wet cake, however, the ricin cemented together forming larger particles. These could not be broken down to their original size by ordinary grinding methods and since a very line particle size was necessary in order that the product might be used as a toxic weapon, it was thought desirable to seek some method to prevent the agglomeration or cementing process that took place on drying. To attempt lo affect this result, physical conditions prevailing under the precipitation process were changed. This included changing the temperature of precipitation and the rate of agitation. Other changes included precipitation with only partial saturation of Na2SO4 and the use of wetting and seeding agents. None of these expedients produced any significant improvement in particle size. Ordinary dry ball and hammer milling of the dried ricin produced considerable detoxification perhaps due to the generation of excess heat. The use of CCl4 slurry plus the use of low temperature and low moisture content of the ricin reduced detoxification during ball milling. Spray drying proved to be an even better method of securing a reasonably small particle size. Best results were achieved by using a solution having about 20% solids, an inlet temperature of 150″C. and an atomizing air pressure of 150 to 180 p.s.i. The particle size secured was 6 to 8 mu. The best means of securing a small particle size was by air grinding. This was carried out in an apparatus having a chamber with conical top and bottom. The material to be ground has been fed into this chamber and is withdrawn from the bottom and forced back into the center of the chamber tangentially through a venturi. Compressed air of about 100 p.s.i. was fed to the venturi to provide the grinding force. The fines are drawn off the top and the large particles settle to the bottom to be recirculated and reground. This process produced particles having a mass median diameter of 2.5 to 3.5 mu. Numerous variations are possible in the several steps of the process commencing with the water extraction and precipitation which may be a single or multiple step. Although a single extraction step can be used, as indicated before, some process modifications are necessary for its successful operation on a plant scale. Double extraction proved to be quite efficient but additional steps beyond the second extraction step were not found necessary.\n",

      "We've gotta chat. No, you're not in trouble. *whew.* We just have some changes we're making that we want to talk to you guys about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since reaching one million subscribers three months ago, we're **already** almost a quarter of the way to two million on this sub alone! The Discord server has seen massive growth, along with TGN. We are proud and honoured to be modding one of the biggest dedicated communities for teenagers. I've been here for four years now as both a user and a mod, and to see how this community has grown and expanded amazes me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course with this expansion comes evolution. We added the most moderators at one time ever in the history of this sub back in March! Even with that large addition, there has been a recent boom in rule-breaking posts we've been struggling to deal with. Quite honestly, it had taken a toll on morale due to the sheer amount of work we were encountering multiple times a day. We felt as if we had no time to be there for the community as users, as event planners, and as effective mods. We also felt that the direction of the sub had started to head towards a meme dumping and karma farming ground, steering away from our philosophy of being a teenaged content driven discussion sub. We have decided to implement changes to help combat all of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "**a)** Specific rule-breaking posts such as vote manipulation will now be automatically removed instead of filtered into modqueue for us to manually remove. You will receive messages detailing why your post was removed, and a way to contact us if it was done in error. Please take note that this is in no way *newly* restricting content. It's just a way to automate removals we would have done ourselves. If you encounter the bot being wonky, please modmail us with the issue and let us know so we can fix it.\n",
      "\n",
      "**b)** Self-post weekend will be extended to include Fridays now! This means that the new time it starts is Friday 12:00 am GMT instead of Saturday 12:00 am GMT. The end time of Sunday 11:59 pm GMT has not been changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**c)** 'Casual AMAs' are no longer allowed. Unfortunately, the AMA rule is consistently broken throughout every hour of self-post weekend. We are unable to consistently or effectively moderate them due to the sheer volume of low-effort AMAs. We believe that better conversations and fun can be had through higher effort discussion posts and more engagement than just a question drop. Understandably, some may be upset by this removal. Keep in mind that ARC will be announced by the end of the week! If you are chosen, you can help us brainstorm ideas on ways that can help fill the void of casual AMAs. Even if you aren't picked as ARC, you can always talk with ARC members or moderators and discuss your ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's all the changes we have. It is our priority to be effective moderators who are able to serve the community well so we hope you understand why we have to make these changes. All of these changes will allow us to have time to plan and coordinate fun events and fun changes for you guys, especially during the summer. We have some goodies in the back of our head planned for you guys already; ARC will be defo adding even more goodies to that list so stay tuned. \n",
      "\n",
      "We understand that there may be some discontent, and that is a-ok. Feedback whether positive or negative is encouraged. **All we ask is that it is constructive feedback, and that the constructive feedback is kept contained within this thread or in our modmail so that we can listen to you guys and keep track of what you're thinking!** We only want the best for the community, so help us honour that commitment. :) \n",

Shows like Big Mouth and Sex Education are not only popular, they have a much healthier expression of sexuality than movies/shows of the past.

Especially the cursed plague guy. Now comedyheaven, for example, actually has a good mod team. They made a discord server where everyone is able to share their memes when the sub isn't too active, since that's pretty heavily moderated. But the biggest difference is that the mod team actively reaches out to the community for their opinions on the state of the sub, all of the issues that they see with it, and they all obviously try their hardest in terms of modding over the cursed images mod team who just lazily decide based on personal opinion over what the sub is about. People post actual cursed things that are immediately filtered out of new yet completely uncursed things are put into hot and after its complained about the mods say \"we don't have enough time or an organized schedule to filter out 100% of the bad content\". It was one of the top posts on hot and even after the mod was alerted to it, checked back a day later, post was still there. Another thing I have spotted is another example of why cursed_images has an incompetent mod team: the way they filter out bad content. Cursedimages uses a system where they filter out the content after it's posted, while Comedyheaven uses a system where posts have to be approved before they're posted. \n",

I will probably let them use messaging services but not the ones like snapchat which is just as bad as all tiktok and insta those sorta things and even then not until at least 13, I will allow things like youtube as I don't see that as a big threat because it's not super addictive like short form content, that is if anything but short form content exists 💀\n",

I quit social media for a while after I lost my phone in a field after a couple months without tiktok my adhd improved significantly.

When people send you selfies they are always altered with some type of filter that makes you look better, or they'll completely scribble out their face in black. Anyone who has snapchat will know about snapbacks, I never fell victim to this but basically everyone else I know has, its basically where you send a snap( basically a picture ) and the recipient responds back with another snap, completely pointless but people do it because it adds to their snap score or should I say a number that tells people how much of your life you have wasted. So basically everyday I opened my phone I saw a million people who had sent me a picture of their wall and expect me to return the favour. I was talking to my friend who I referenced earlier in my rant and I saw her do that snapback thing and I asked her why she participated in it and she said because of the snapscore stuff and because if you snapback people every day you get streaks which is just a count of how many days in a row you snapback a person.

Or you can get pfed from decongestive pills like sudafed. Most people perfer to work with pfed from pills rather then ephed from the plant. The important thing is that you must have pure pfed/ephed as any contaminants will fuck up the molar ratio leaving you with over-reduced shit or under-reduced shit. Or contaminats will jell durring baseifying and gak up your product which will then be very hard to clean. So you want to find a pill that is nearly pure pfed hcl, or as close to pure as you can get. Also check the lable on your pills and see what inactive ingredients they contain. Inactive ingredients are things like binders and flavors. These you dont want and will remove when cleaning your pills. but certain inactive ingredients are harder to remove then others. You dont want pills with a red coating, you dont want pills with alot of cellose in them and you dont want pills with much wax. you also dont want pills that contain povidone. As a rule, if you have a two pills that contain the same amount of pfed hcl then take the smaller sized pill because it obviously has less binders and inactive ingredients, time released pills are usualy harder to work with because they have more binders and tend to gel up durring the a/b stage. Also only buy pills that have pfed hcl as the only active ingredient.

When making hydroiodic acid from iodine and red phosphorus, the acid is prepared first, and allowed to come to complete reaction for 20 minutes before adding the ephedrine to it. The way around the roadblock here is to just boil off some more of the water from the ephedrine extract, and make the acid mixture in fresh pure water. Since the production of HI from iodine and red phosphorus gives off a good deal of heat, it is wise to chill the mixture in ice, and slowly add the iodine crystals to the red phosphorus-water mixture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Making Methamphetamine: To do the reaction, a 1000 ml round bottom flask is filled with 150 grams of ephedrine. Also added to the flask are 40 grams of red phosphorus and 340 ml of 47% hydroiodic acid. This same acid and red phosphorus mixture can be prepared from adding 150 grams of iodine crystals to 150 grams of red phosphorus in 300 ml of water. This should produce the strong hydroiodic acid solution needed. Exactly how strong the acid needs to be, I can't say . With the ingredients mixed together in the flask, a condenser is attached to the flask, and the mixture is boiled for one day. This length of time is needed for best yields and highest octane numbers on the product. While it is cooking, the mixture is quite red and messy looking from the red phosphorus floating around in it.When one day of boiling under reflux is up, the flask is allowed to cool, then it is diluted with an equal volume of water. Next, the red phosphorus is filtered out. A series of doubled up coffee filters will work to get out all the red phosphorus, but real filter paper is better. The filtered solution should look a golden color. A red color may indicate that all the red phosphorus is not yet out. If so, it is filtered again. The filtered-out phosphorus can be saved for use in the next batch. If filtering does not remove the red color, there may be iodine floating around the solution. It can be removed by adding a few dashes of sodium bisulfate or sodium thiosulfate.The next step in processing the batch is to neutralize the acid. A strong lye solution is mixed up and added to the batch while shaking until the batch is strongly basic. This brings the meth out as liquid free base floating on top of the water. The strongly basic solution is shaken vigorously to ensure that all the meth has been converted to the free base. You now can sell or use the free base for injection use or with free base meth now obtained, the next step you can do is to form the crystalline hydrochloride salt of meth. To do this, a few hundred mls of toluene is added to the batch, and the meth free base extracted out as usual. If the chemist's cooking has been careful, the color of the toluene extract will be clear to pale yellow. If this is the case, the product is sufficiently pure to make nice white crystals just by bubbling dry HCl gas through the toluene extract. If the toluene extract is darker colored, a distillation is called for to get pure meth free base. The yield of pure methamphetamine hydrochloride should be from 100 to 110 grams.\n",

      "## Do what fits you best\n",
      "\n",
      "If you can only upload once every week, or once every month, it is fine. As long as you stick through it and keep quality content in all aspects, the result will be the same as if you uploaded every day like most famous YouTubers currently manage to do. In this situation, the key to success is consistency.\n",

      "## Should I invest in equipment?\n",
      "\n",
      "Unless you are stupidly creative, MAYBE you could manage to become successful in YouTube by just utilizing your phone camera and some really good ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "## What is considered “quality content” in YouTube?\n",
      "\n",
      "Sadly (for you and creators only), the reality is that it has been more than 10 years since YouTube was created. It’s public, we the consumers, have gotten more demanding with the content we watch on this platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The TRUTH about successful videos in YouTube (in most cases)\n",
      "\n",
      "Nowadays if your videos don’t have a perfect pitch and synchronized audio matched with a 4K to 1080p resolution, then your video will not get as much support as you’d expect, despite the content or topic is good or not. This doesn’t mean that you cannot succeed in your goals as a YouTuber, but good quality audio and image can sure help you speed up the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Making a budget for YouTube equipment\n",
      "\n",
      "When buying equipment opinions may vary. Some may recommend starting cheap, or “average” and then upgrade with time as you advance with your YouTuber journey. Others may recommend not even buying stuff at all. In my opinion, maybe is not a bad idea to start buying cheap or with a small budget, but if you know you can spend more, belief, you won’t regret it.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Why buying mid-range is not always the solution\n",
      "\n",
      "If you already know how to work with video production, you’d obviously opt for a pro version of what you are buying, but if you’re just starting, I recommend you do it as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Why consider buying the pro or high-end equipment as an amateur YouTuber\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re already motivated to start with this experience, I recommend buying the pro versions of most equipment. In this way, even if at the beginning you don’t understand how to work at full “power” and take advantage of all their features, you have the ability to learn about them. The budget options of many products may or may not often have features that can prevent you from learning how to make REAL quality content since the begging. If you think of these purchases from a long-term perspective, you end up getting a better “bang-for-buck” as if you had bought a budget camera, mic, computer, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Buy cheap or buy twice\n",
      "\n",
      "Let´s say you finally decided to obtain the “budget” option for every piece of equipment. After 4 months in the YouTuber journey, you decide to learn how to edit high-resolution pictures or upload 4K videos. Now you have to buy another camera that can photograph and film in the highest resolution{ you’d want. Also, your budget computer cannot handle all that data that needs to be processed during the video and photo editing, and so on. If you decide to buy the new equipment, then you’ve spent more money than was planned and wasted time using this equipment which could have been invested in learning how to use the quality tech products you could have bought since the beginning.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Baby steps first\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember that in most cases or at least at the beginning, views and subscribers may take a while to show. Once you have a certain amount of content uploaded to your channel, depending on if you maintain your “niche” and followed the previous steps, it will start increasing the attention on the internet.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Finding your target audience\n",
      "\n",
      "After you started and have enough videos to entertain an audience, you can start experimenting with subjects you like and seeing what are the videos that get more views. To find the niche of your channel, it is important to check what are the videos that are getting the most attention or views. Next, find if these have something in common. Now that you found what are their similarities, focus your future videos on this content.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Enjoy the content you are making\n",
      "\n",
      "I just told you to make small changes and focus on certain topics, but just for focusing on more quality content. If you find that other content that you don’t enjoy making is getting more views, it doesn’t matter. Views will always come and go, regarding the content you upload. The important thing is to enjoy having an audience that appreciates and supports your work.\n",

      "## Affiliate marketing\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s say the current situation of your channel is around 1k to 10k or even 25k views per video uploaded. Now you can opt to start connecting with small companies (if they were not already working with you). You can offer your services to make affiliate marketing in small segments of your channel. Affiliate marketing will help you create one of your first streams of income.\n",

      "## Google Adsense\n",
      "\n",
      "With Google Adsense, you can start building passive income after uploading your videos, but this is not the best way of making money for newer YouTubers, due to the small percentage of income your videos may or may not generate at the beginning.\n",
      "\n",
      "## How much can I earn with Google Adsense?\n",
      "\n",
      "Depending on your location in the world, Google can pay you around 20 cents up to $2 USD per 1,000 views.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Disadvantages of Google Adsense (ADS)\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, you can’t just start using these services as soon you create your channel. First, YouTube demands the channel to have a certain amount of subscribers, which is quite high. Another problem with ads is that YouTube takes it seriously when it comes to “PG” rated content and copyright.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Having different streams of income\n",
      "\n",
      "With time, you’ll be experimenting with different streams of income. These will help you reinvest in your channel and motivate you to keep creating the quality videos your audience deserves.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Dealing with haters\n",
      "\n",
      "I would say not to read the comments, but it is the only way to have contact with your audience. I suggest only reading the ones that really deserve your attention. Your first supporters will always be there to have your back. The hate comments will just act in favor of the “YouTube algorithm” and bring more views to your videos. People that write these comments don’t have a life or anything worth doing with their time. My recommendation is just to get used to them and see them as passive sources of marketing income. Lmao.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Know the difference between feedback and criticism\n",
      "\n",
      "Haters will always talk bad about you and focus on the wrong things just to create attention. Your audience (subscribers) helps you improve and could even assist with future video ideas. They take a huge part in the improvement of your channel.\n",
      "\n",
      "## YouTube algorithm\n",
      "\n",
      "As the last topic of the blog, I needed to mention how the platform works. To not make it more complex than it already is, I’ll summarize it for you:\n",
      "\n",
      "It is basically a system that shows the most liked and commented videos to more consumers of the platform. As these videos grow in views, they grow in likes and comments. The views and likes ratio should be even to the consumer’s watch time. This explains why most videos take exactly 10 to 20 minutes. 10 to 20-minute videos tend to have more space for ads and reach a bigger audience.\n",

      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Congrats! You’ve made it. After reading this blog, you should have enough information to be capable to manage a YouTube channel for the long term. Rember to focus on topics you enjoy doing and only look back to learn from mistakes. The key to success in YouTube is not only consistency but discipline. Add this method to your life, make your days more productive, take advantage of every second of the day and just enjoy the process.\n",

      "## YouTube is your second school\n",
      "\n",
      "My point of view of this social media changed when I realized I was losing too much time on it. The videos I used to watch weren’t even educational in any form. They were just memes, compilations of funny videos (when Vine was famous), and stupid blogs from these new individuals that called themselves “YouTubers”. (Which was something new back then)productive, take advantage of every second of the day, and just enjoy the process. If you think of these purchases from a long-term perspective, you end up getting a better “bang-for-buck” as if you had bought a budget camera, mic, computer, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Title: Laptop shopping is so frustrating\n",
      "Content: First of all, it's kinda annoying that I even need a new laptop at all. The only inadequate parts of the current one are the GPU which is failing and the CPU which uses too much electricity causing battery life to be shit. The battery is in OK condition, and the body, screen, and trackpad are still good. It's annoying that I have to replace the whole laptop. On a desktop, this would just be a new CPU, a new mobo, possibly a new cooler (because new socket), new RAM (DDR3 to DDR4), and *maybe* a new GPU (because integrated graphics on new CPUs seem to be better than my dGPU).\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, the spec filters are infuriating. On almost every site, checking one box almost always means immediately reloading the entire page before I can check more. No checking them in batches. And for some reason, there usually isn't an option for \"or better.\" For example, if I check \"Ryzen 5\", it excludes Ryzen 7 CPUs unless I also check them. If I check 8GB of RAM, it excludes machines with 12GB or 16GB unless I explicitly include them too. While most sites at least have them actually work, on Amazon the spec filters are usually blatantly ignored. I've actually had better luck putting my specs as keywords on Amazon than using their spec filter, but either way I always get a bunch of results that do not meet the specs I explicitly search for (4GB of RAM when I search for 8GB, 64GB eMMC when I search for 256 or 512 GB SSD, etc.), and it's even more common if I sort by low price, which I have to do because by default they recommend me $800-$1000+ machines even when $500-$600 should be more than enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, there's the product listings themselves. You have to scroll through pages upon pages of \"This laptop is powerful enough to handle all the tasks that you throw at it. Enjoy videos with a beautiful screen and Dolby speakers. With long lasting battery, this laptop will be ready whenever you are\" to find the specs at or near the bottom. You usually don't get power information beyond baseless \"lasts 300 hours\" claims (and I've seen a few listings that don't even make those claims), usually not even the battery capacity in WHr. I've never seen a listing actually state something like how much power the screen uses as a function of brightness or how much the CPU uses as a function of utilization, so power usage has to be guessed in order to estimate battery life, assuming you even get to know the size of the battery. You're almost never told whether the USB-C port is just for data or if it also supports things like DisplayPort, MFDP, or USB-PD. I've never seen a listing say how many RAM slots are soldered and how many are socketed (I'm lucky if they even say whether it's single or dual channel), nor have I seen one stating whether there is a 2.5in bay (so I know if I need a 512GB SSD or if I can buy with a 256GB SSD and slap in one of my already existing drives to bring it up to ~500GB). In order to find out stuff like that, I usually have to look at teardown videos on Youtube, which for some reason seem to rarely have the model number in the name, so I often have to guess at if the computer depicted is even the right one. Additionally, on Amazon, some listings have wrong or nonsensical information. I've seen the same listing having both 1366x768 and 1920x1080 in different places on the page, shit like \"Intel Ryzen 7 3500U dual core\", and SSDs described as 5400 RPM and 7200 RPM.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's so annoying. Why can't sites that sell laptops have CORRECT, DETAILED, and EASY TO READ listings about their products, as well as filters that aren't painful to use and actually work? I'm literally trying to throw money at them, and they're making it so hard. (And don't tell me to just buy a desktop. It has to be a laptop because I need the portability.)\n",

      "Content: Okay I can already smell the shitstorm of comments that say \"lolol hipster\". Anyway, my point is that now, the frontpage is litterally filled with memes and shitty compressed images that you'd find on facebook/instagram. I've only been on here for 3 years so I don't claim to be some \"veteran\" I'd just like to point out I've noticed a decline in quality posts. At least you can filter out posts based on flairs though. Back when I first joined, like any new redditor, I subscribed to a bunch of subreddits. I probably was subscribed to nearly 50 at one point. Despite being subscribed to a lot of those subreddits, /r/teenagers was the one subreddit where I would actually visit the subreddit instead of looking at content off the front page. I remember going through like 100 pages of /r/teenagers a night.\n",

I think there was more quality content 2 years ago compared to now. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy this sub and probably will considering I'll be a teenager for a good while. I'm just saying that I remember having more thought provoking discussions and I would always read this sub with a smile on my face.

      "Content: Hey fellas, I know that most of you probably don’t care about this topic or anything but I think it’s important to clear the air a little bit since (especially recently with some friends) it seems that not everyone is in the loop about this, plus also this is just a post I’ve been wanting to make for a while. So marijuana eh? Some people think it’s in a similar category as other drugs such as nic or xans or something, and I do think that that claim has some merit since weed is a psychoactive substance, however I also think there’s another side to it as well, recently there has been some pushback when it comes to legalizing cannabis in the states for medical use and recreational use, I think it’s important to clear some things up before we cast judgement \n",
      "\n",
      "So in the marijuana plant there are two main psychoactive compounds that do the fun stuff in your brain, THC and CBD, you may have heard of CBD when it comes to CBD gummies and such, however I think it’s important to understand the differences between these two substances and how they affect your brain. When it comes to THC the effects are much more noticeable and potent, THC is the main ingredient which causes someone to get high, while CBD doesn’t make you high, in fact CBD has been shown to help with pain, stress anxiety, mood and all sorts of other stuff, and while THC can also help with those, THC is also what causes you to feel high, think of it like this, THC is the fun one while CBD is the medical one, because of this when it comes to medical use it is suggested that you pick a product with a high CBD content and a low THC content, thats if your mainly looking for the medical benefits of marijuana \n",
      "\n",
      "However when it comes to stoners a lot of them will become uptight with the idea of addiction, let me tell you, addiction to weed is a very real and (in my opinion) not covered enough thing, now compared to other drugs Mary Jane doesn’t have very strong withdrawal effects, that is unless you been smoking like a gram a day for the past 3 years, however it still is addictive, at least THC is addictive since that’s the main chemical which does the funny fun stuff in your brain, it just concerns me how when it comes to the “weed crowd” people seem to sweep the addiction part under the rug and pretend it doesn’t exist, since many of the people addicted to it don’t think they have a problem, I was like that at one point until I started to notice I’d feel like shit when I didn’t get my daily carcinogen inhalation. Luckily it’s been a minute since then but I don’t think people are taking it seriously enough, especially now with these new strains in the 25-30% THC range, at that point you can’t really come up with an argument supporting it since if you do smoke that 30% shit your not gonna get any medical benefits from it, you’ll just be couch locked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now this isn’t trying to put those people to shame, everything in moderation and all, but if your smoking high THC bud every day, perhaps multiple times a day, and then turn around and say “oh but it has medical benefits and I’m not addicted” you kinda just look like an ass, I’m sorry but I feel like not enough people are admitting that. Thanks for coming to my TED talk, if I taught at least one person something they didn’t know/made someone reconsider their stance on pot then I’ll consider this post a win\n",

      "\n",
      "When you’re a student trying to memorize and understand a lot of new information, it’s important to keep your health in top shape. Staying healthy can promote academic performance and help you reach your educational goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although an overall healthy diet is most important for keeping your body and brain nourished and ready to take on difficult tasks, research shows that certain foods may be especially important for brain health and promoting mental performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following foods have been linked to improved brain health and make excellent choices when you’re cramming for an exam.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the top 9 brain foods for studying.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Berries\n",
      "Berries are rich in a variety of compounds that may help promote academic performance and protect the health of your brain. Berries, including blueberries, strawberries, and blackberries, are especially high in flavonoid compounds called anthocyanins.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Citrus fruits \n",
      "Citrus fruits are highly nutritious, and their intake has been linked to a variety of health benefits, including the promotion of brain health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly to berries, citrus fruits like oranges and grapefruit are rich in flavonoids, including hesperidin, naringin, quercetin, and rutin, among others.\n",
      "\n",
      "These compounds may have the ability to promote learning and memory, as well as protect nerve cells from injury, therefore warding off mental decline\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Dark chocolate and cocoa products\n",
      "Cocoa has the highest flavonoid content by weight of any other food, which is why cocoa products like chocolate significantly contribute to dietary flavonoid intake. Consuming flavonoid-rich cocoa products may favorably affect brain health.\n",
      "\n",
      "In one study, 90 older adults with mild mental impairment drank a cocoa beverage containing either 45 mg, 520 mg, or 990 mg of cocoa flavonoids per serving once a day for 8 weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Nuts \n",
      "Nuts are packed with nutrients that are essential for brain health, including vitamin E and zinc. They’re also portable and versatile, making them an excellent choice for study snacks.\n",
      "Nuts are concentrated sources of healthy fat, protein, and fiber, and they can help keep you fueled throughout marathon study sessions. Plus, some research shows that snacking on nuts may even help improve certain aspects of brain function.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Eggs\n",
      "Eggs are often referred to as nature’s multivitamin due to the variety of nutrients they contain. They’re particularly rich in nutrients that are necessary for brain function, including vitamin B12, choline, and selenium.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Avocados \n",
      "Avocados are versatile fruits that can be enjoyed in several ways, including mashed into guacamole, spread on toast, or simply enjoyed whole with a bit of salt. As a convenient study snack, they may also help boost your brain function.\n",
      "\n",
      "They’re an excellent source of lutein, a carotenoid that accumulates in your brain and eyes and may positively influence brain function\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Fish\n",
      "Omega-3s are essential fats that play important roles in brain health. They’re concentrated in fatty fish, which are also excellent sources of other brain-health-promoting nutrients like vitamin B12 and selenium.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s no surprise that a number of studies have linked fish intake to enhanced brain function.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Beets\n",
      "Beets and beet products are rich in nitrates, which your body converts into a molecule called nitric oxide. Nitric oxide plays many important roles in your health, including proper nerve cell communication, blood flow, and brain function.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Red, green, and orange vegetables\n",
      "Vegetable intake in general is associated with better brain function and the promotion of overall health.\n",

      "\n",
      "TL:DR\n",
      "\n",
      "The new law coming boils down to how porn sites must now have really strong controls restricting under 18’s viewing the content. All sites must have a new layer of security which includes something credit card log in. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the surface, this seems like a great step forward but when you actually put proper thought into it, the law has clearly been made by someone who doesn’t actually know much about technology and it’s effect on people. I’m going to be 18 by the time it is in place (currently 17) but it’s super worrying for people younger. This is because, whatever happens, teenagers will get curious and search things online. No new law will fix the mess of hormones which we’re all going through. This means that people will search longer for it and will only be able to access the sites which are dodgy enough not to contain the new credit card thing, leading to the whole law being very counter productive and giving a potentially even more unhealthy view of the reality of sex for some very vulnerable teenagers.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s just the ethical side of the new law, it becomes more clear on how little the people who proposed this law know about technology the more you look in to it. First off, it would mean putting the entire countries credit card details on the database of a porn site, which clearly isn’t going to be secure if places such as Mariot can get hacked. However, most noticeably, if the UK is the only country to go this, a simple VPN will completely undercut the system (a VPN basically makes it look to the website like you’re from another place). The vast majority of people 15+ know of or know someone who knows of a VPN and will quickly and fairly easily just go round the new credit card things. The people who won’t are the people who are just looking at it for the first time. Teenagers who are on the younger side who have heard of porn and are interested in it, again, meaning that they will only find the sites which are dodgier, being completely counter productive. \n",
      "\n",
      "To conclude, this law will not specifically affect me, even if I wasn’t 18, I do a level computer science and definitely know how to get round it. It will effect vulnerable teenagers as it was clearly proposed by someone who didn’t know about technology and even clearly doesn’t know about teenagers. A simple interview with a group of teenagers would have brought up many of the points I am making here and how counter productive the law is to the most vulnerable teenagers who are just discovering the mess that can be hormones.\n",

      "\n",
      "TL:DR\n",
      "There is a new law coming into place attempting to ban porn for u18’s properly but will actually be very counter productive for the most vulnerable teenagers due to over-sites. Also, the technologically wise, it’s useless to VPN’s and a massive data protection risk.\n",

Unfortunately, the money and fame got to James which lead him to become selfish and money hungry. \n",

      "Tati already had problems with James in the past but what happened between them recently was the breaking point where Tati just had enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tati released her new product called halo which are some kind of healthy vitamin pills. James has been supporting her brand, and he knows how much it means to her.  However, James decided to sponsored another vitamin brand called sugar bear hair which is a brand that is similar to Tati’s. Tita’s pissed off that James decided to sponsor a brand that she was a rival with.\n",

      "Content: Fast fashion is our downfall \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone knows the excitement of unwrapping a gift, buying new shoes or having a package delivered at your door. Simply because this means that you are now owner of a new item, which makes that item, and yourself, interesting. On top of that, product prices these days are so low, that sometimes, it is hard to not give in and just buy something. Also, the way social media are getting faster at setting new trends, stimulates us to buy even more stuff. And there you have it, fast fashion; the speed of trends that force us to join capitalism. We should stop fast fashion, as it leads to overconsumption, it stimulates unfair labour practices, and it results in toxic behaviour. \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Let us start with a quick bit of background information. Fast fashion is mainly caused by social media like TikTok, Instagram or Twitter. Back in the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st century, trends were influenced by celebrities and magazines. Therefore, only a small group of people set the trends, and these trends would last many years. A pair of jeans you would buy in 1974, would still be considered hip in 1983, for example. Today though, trends are set by social media influencers. Literally anyone can become influencer, the only thing you must do is have a high number of followers, and post, preferable daily, preferably creative, content. Since there are so many people influencing us now, daily, trends go by a lot quicker. This is bad. \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "As I have mentioned in the thesis, fast fashion leads to overconsumption. Mainly the ‘haul trend', a trend where people, mostly fashion influencers, buy a crazy amount of fashion from cheap clothing brands, leads to this capitalistic trait. TikTokers will buy $1000 of Shein clothing, just for a few seconds of fame, and throw all of it away in the next two months. This, of course, is the absolute worst for our environment, especially since most of cheap clothing consists of synthetic fibres that take about 2 centuries to decompose. People who cannot afford sustainable fashion are not the problem, people that can afford sustainable fashion and still choose to buy tons of cheap clothes are the main problem here. Cheap fashion brands and social media stimulate this behaviour though, so it is hard not to give in and join the overconsumption.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "To continue, there is another reason than just cheap synthetic fibres for these clothes to be so affordable; unfair labour practices. October 2022, an undercover investigation revealed that employees of the brand Shein work seven days a week, some of them for only $556 a month. Another fashion brand, Fashion Nova, recording to a 2019 report by Natalie Kitroeff, paid their employees $2.77 per hour, which is far below minimum wage. How this is possible with all the laws regarding wage, is still a mystery. It makes sense though, because how else could fashion brands sell clothing for $1.75? (check the link to the Shein website, I will admit that it is not my style)\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to that, fast fashion is toxic. It stimulates a throw-away-culture, by making consumers buy way more than they need. This leads to the mindset that you can just throw anything away, because it does not matter anyways. The same thing will happen to food and other things we consume, it will just be thrown away as soon as consumers stop liking it. Fast fashion is also toxic because of all the influencers that tell us to get rid of a certain shirt we adore, just because it is not ‘trendy’ anymore. This results in dilemmas; \"Should I keep these pants or not? Will people hate me for keeping these shoes? Am I cool enough? I want to wear this shirt but is it still hip?” The reason this is toxic, is that everyone will, at one point, have the exact same clothes and style, and if someone is different, then that means that they do not fit in. This has a negative impact on individuals, especially young individuals. Can they not just be themselves?\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "All with all, I think it is fair to conclude that fast fashion is bad for society, environment and just about everything. It stimulates bad behaviour and unfair labour. It pollutes the entire world with synthetic fibres and our minds with a throw-away-mindset. So please, think before you buy something, try to buy second-hand clothing, or just try to last one more winter with that sweater.\n",

      "Content: ####Message from the Head Moderator\n",
      "I'm very happy to announce the return of Mod Mondays. In the past, every Monday a stickied post was made where the moderators could talk about small things to keep the community updated with what has been going on. The posts will generally be an opportunity and a place for the community to voice their opinions of the subreddit and this should essentially help to create a communicative link between the moderating team and the userbase. If there is something that I specifically would like to talk to the userbase about, I will try to add in a small section at the beginning like this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the recent additions to the mod team, a lot of slack has been picked up in terms of cleaning out certain posts that spam the subreddit. It's been a great weight that has been lifted off my shoulders and of course the shoulders of the /u/NSA-Surveillance and /u/HalfofAKebab. The new moderators have been very active in their jobs and have taken to the moderation quicker than any new moderators I have ever seen in my days on the modteam. That said they're still getting to grips with a lot of the different aspects of the subreddit, so do bear with them in their efforts to make the subreddit better. They've also helped to give a lot of great ideas which we'll be hoping to discuss further in our mod meetings and come up with ways of effective methods of implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "With school pretty much beginning once again, the subreddit tends to see a decline in some activity. We essentially plan on creating some more events and school orientated posts that can help everyone but also essentially help to drive the activity at a steady rate rather than just everything being a straight up ghost town, which to be honest, hardly never happens on a subreddit of 109k subscribers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I'm very much hoping to taking a lot more of a backseat approach to moderating the subreddit. With my own school workload increasing exponentially in just the last few days, I'm hoping to set things up and basically get everything started and have the rest of the mod team such as the newbies drive it all forward while I manage the admin related stuff from behind the scenes. This I really hope will take things off my plate and also by delegation make things run a lot smoother. \n",

This will not only help to reduce spam but also reduce the incentive of getting \"karma\" points through an easy and lazy post.

Right now it's used through the search system, but we would also be inclined to make this work through the languages structure of reddit and see how it works out. We also think it would be useful to make the filtering system more accessible rather than how it is currently in the sidebar. We're also discussing a way to revamp the way AutoMod functions with the tags and also a way for the /u/rteenagers_bot to removed unflaired posts. \n",

      " List of chemicals and materials: Diluted HCl - also called Muriatic acid - can be obtained from hardware stores, in the pool section  NaOH - also called lye  Ethyl Ether - aka Diethyl Ether - Et-0-Et - can be obtained from engine starting fluid, usually from a large supermarket. Look for one that says \"high ethyl ether content\", such as Prestone  Ephedrine The cottons in todays vicks nasle inhalers dont contain efed or pfed (ephedrin or psuedoephedrin) but there are still lots of easy ways to get good ephed or pfed, pure ephedrin can be extracted out of it's plant matter, from a plant that can be bought at most garden stores. Or you can get pfed from decongestive pills like sudafed. Most people perfer to work with pfed from pills rather then ephed from the plant. The important thing is that you must have pure pfed/ephed as any contaminants will fuck up the molar ratio leaving you with over-reduced shit or under-reduced shit. Or contaminats will jell durring baseifying and gak up your product which will then be very hard to clean. So you want to find a pill that is nearly pure pfed hcl, or as close to pure as you can get. Also check the lable on your pills and see what inactive ingredients they contain. Inactive ingredients are things like binders and flavors. These you dont want and will remove when cleaning your pills. but certain inactive ingredients are harder to remove then others. You dont want pills with a red coating, you dont want pills with alot of cellose in them and you dont want pills with much wax. you also dont want pills that contain povidone. As a rule, if you have a two pills that contain the same amount of pfed hcl then take the smaller sized pill because it obviously has less binders and inactive ingredients, time released pills are usualy harder to work with because they have more binders and tend to gel up durring the a/b stage. Also only buy pills that have pfed hcl as the only active ingredient. You first have to make ephedrine (which is sometimes sold as meth by itself):If you are selling it...I would just make ephedrine and say it's meth.  Distilled water - it's really cheap, so you have no reason to use the nasty stuff from the tap. Do things right.  List of equipment : A glass eyedropper   Three small glass bottles with lids (approx. 3 oz., but not important)one should be marked at 1.5oz, use tape on the outside to mark it (you might want to label it as ether). One should be clear (and it can't be the marked one).  A Pyrex dish (the meatloaf one is suggested)   A glass quart jar   Sharp scissors  Clean rubber gloves  Coffee filters  A measuring cup  Measuring spoons   Preparing your Lab:  Preparing Ethyl Ether: WARNING: Ethyl Ether is very flammable and is heavier than air. Do not use ethyl ether near flame or non-sparkless motors. It is also an anaesthetic and can cause respiratory collapse if you inhale too much.  Take the unmarked small bottle and spray starter fluid in it until it looks half-full. Then fill the rest of the way with water, cap the bottle and shake for 5 minutes. Let it sit for a minute or two, and tap the side to try and separate the clear upper layer. Then, draw off the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, and throw away the lower (water) and cloudy layer. Place the ether in the marked container. Repeat this until you have about 1.5 oz. of ether. Put the cap on it, and put it in the freezer if you can. Rinse the other bottle and let it stand.  Ethyl ether is very pungent. Even a small evaporated amount is quite noticeable.   Ephedrine & or P-Ephedrine: Please discuss this on the neonjoint forum   Pour 1/8 teaspoon of the lye crystals into the bottle of ephedrine and agitate. Do this carefully, as the mixture will become hot, and give off hydrogen gas and/or steam. H2 gas is explosive and lighter than air, avoid any flames as usual. Repeat this step until the mixture remains cloudy. This step neutralizes the HCl in the salt, leaving the insoluble free base (l-desoxyephedrine) again. Why do we do this? So that we can get rid of any water-soluble impurities. For 3 oz. bottles, this should take only 3 repetitions or so.  Fill the bottle from step 5 up the rest of the way with ethyl ether. Cap the bottle, and agitate for about 8 minutes. It is very important to expose every molecule of the free-base to the ether for as long as possible. This will cause the free base to dissolve into the ether (it -is- soluble in ether).   Let the mixture settle. There will be a middle layer that is very thick. Tap the side of the bottle to get this layer as thin as possible. This is why this bottle should be clear.   Remove the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, being careful not to get any of the middle layer in it. Place the removed ether layer into a third bottle.  Add to the third bottle enough water to fill it half-way and about 5 drops of muriatic acid. Cap it. Shake the bottle for 2 minutes. When it settles, remove the top\n",

      "Content: Now I know what some of you are thinking. Things like “shut up normie” and “the Instagram hate meme died out a while ago, why did you write out this whole thing?” and those are both definitely sentences, but as a person who has been using both platforms for years, I think Instagram has a solid case.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what are the main complaints levied against Instagram? First, that the memes are simple, outdated, or bad. Second, that all of the memes on instagram are stolen from reddit and reposted continuously. And last, that posters only post for likes. All of these are either oxymoronic, things reddit is also guilty of, or forgivable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll address the stealing from reddit thing and quality at first. Obviously if the memes on instagram are bad and also stolen from reddit, that would mean the memes on reddit are bad. I don’t want to spend too much time on this, because it’s probably a product of a bunch of different people creating memes about instagram separately instead of a singular idea. It’s still kinda funny though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reddit paints a picture of an infested instagram where there are only reposts. A flock of mindless scrollers who don’t know any better than to feed evil meme account owners greed for likes. This isn’t really accurate. To be honest, it fits as a description of reddit better than it does for instagram. There’s something fundamentally different about the instagram sphere that redditors who have barely used it  don’t quite understand. On instagram, meme theft comes with honesty. Most repost accounts have it in their name or bio. And if you were to ask basically any of them where their memes come from, they would say “I steal them, obviously.” What’s different about reposts on instagram than reddit is that on instagram, a repost is just an attempt to share something fun they found. Redditors are looking at all this open faced reposting with horror like European colonists thinking Native-Americans are savages for basic cultural differences like matriarchy and not having the concept of land ownership. Sure, this way you don’t see quite as many original memes(which we don’t actually have definitive numbers on. It will depend on which people you follow/which subs you use), but  the reposts are sneakily slid into your feed and presenting themselves as original.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereas on Reddit, reposts and karma whore have been made public enemy number one. There's an entire elaborate system where the best content is supposed to float to the top. Karma requirements for posting and superiority complexes  give people actual motivation to repost and karma whore. On instagram, a like has remained just that. It means you liked the post. But on reddit, an [redacted] is an obedience to a failing system. On reddit, it’s your duty to [redacted] good posts and downvote bad ones. There have been good attempts to identify memes with bots and moderation, but the average user does not check the comments of every post and by the time a bot gets called the post is usually on hot already. Also, having such a transparent system for a popular post just makes it easier for karma whores to adapt to what people like. On instagram I immediately know when I’m looking at something resembling karma-whoring because karma-whores are still using minion meme “send to ten people or else” tactics. On reddit karma whores adapt to new formats and trends. Entire subreddits(r/trebuchetmemes for instance) have been consumed because the format for a popular post is so simple and adaptable.\n",

It *was* nice to make memes about Trebuchets and Pewdiepie and the PSAT, but Reddit destroyed those. Niches communities are getting smaller and smaller. When a cool new cartoon comes out the subreddit caps out at a couple thousand users. I just want to look at memes and be part of a community without being lied to.\n",

But I found that keeping a straight face made her give up, if I reacted as a statue would she would gain nothing from it and I could continue on my way. Soon I began to build a structure around my emotions, a simple machine to keep them in line. Living with her gave me plenty of time and drive to push that machine to breaking and repair it better the next time. Until eventually, it was near perfect. And with that perfection came permanence. I stopped making new friends,  seemingly content with those I had. I stopped trying to have fun at school, instead getting through the day so I can get to sleep. I was still social with my friends, smiling and enjoying myself. But I found myself laughing less at their jokes and becoming slowly more detached. That all culminated in one day of school.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was early in the day, a time where students were getting breakfast, I was sitting near a friend who I had slowly started talking to less and less. I have always been a physical kid,  finding a fist fight more fun than any game ever could be, and my friends reflected that. Me and the friend were rough housing, when my friend accidentally did, something, I don’t know what, but something in that kick made me furious, I lept on him, ready to fight as if I was actually needing to defend myself rather than a scuffle between friends. I managed to calm down quickly enough that I never actually swung a blow, but what I did was still noticed. A teacher had seen and sent us to the principles office where I thought about what just happened, I was so mad after that kick that i was about to punch my friend in the face and slam the back of his head against the wall. I apologized saying I didn’t know what came over me and we were let off with a warning. From that point of the machine I had built was no longer a containing cage, it was a controlling vise. That clamp stayed right from then onward. I stuck to those friends that I was still close with and effectively cut out the rest. \n",
      "\n",
      "All of that to say, I would describe myself as emotionally stunted in some way. And only recently have I realized that this machine I have built might not be oh so good for me. Only in the last year have I loosened it even a little. And it felt weird. Almost immediately afterward I had my first ever crush, my literal first. I took about a month of realizing what I was feeling before I confessed. This person I had a crush on was a friend of mine for a few years before this, we got along well.  \n",
      "\n",
      "They did not feel the same, this was the outcome I imagined to be most likely, and I thought I was fine with that, I felt fine with that. And then I mucked it up. I was an ass, I think I was in the following few days the worst person I have ever been. I was letting my emotions run amok. And I hurt my friend,  not physically,  but mentally. I didn’t realize it, I didn’t know what I was doing or why I was doing it. But that night my friend messaged me and told me they would like some distance. And then is when I had realized what I had done. Before I could process it I agreed, and we cut contact for a while. When I had managed to really process what I had done wrong I clamp again shut the vise that was the machine. I clamped it so tight that I cut contact not just with that one friend, but everyone, for a week. I would wake up, go to school. Read, do my work, read. I sat away from my group of friends, I did not talk to my parents when I got home, I simply walked into my room and read until I went to sleep. I did not even have contact with anyone online, I didn’t even touch my phone that entire week. \n",
      "After the vise had shut and I analyzed what I did with a less emotional eye, I promptly apologized, in the only way I knew how in that state. Formally. I wrote in concise, short, to the point sentences that came off as robotic. Like I was an PR department AI response bot for myself. \n",
      "\n",
      "After that week I started talking to people again and loosened the vise somewhat. But I kept it clamped shut for the rest of the year and beyond until I had the realization once more that the vise was not healthy the way I was using it. I was just further hindering myself in the future. I’m better now, I talk to my classmates periodically, I’m friendly with a few of my teachers, and I am growing as a person.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not know why I am writing this anymore, I’ve forgotten the reason but I do know something. The vise is scary. It is useful, and has gifted me with great control over my emotional state.

Basically, at first I thought that the bedrock update for Minecraft was good, but no, it’s starting to become a massive fuck-up in my mind. I have some old maps on PS3 (I play on PS4) and I want to transfer them. Of course, I turned 13 in July, and before then I just really didn’t give a damn about any social media. I didn’t know they were cutting support for transferring worlds. I have a few old and massive worlds I made, but of course I can’t transfer them now. Even if I did know about them cutting the support, I wouldn’t have been able to do it, because my older brother had the Minecraft disk and PS3 was, and still is, unable to scan discs. And here’s another part: being able to customize flat worlds. Of course, somebody’s going to say that I can just switch back to the old version and make a world. I understand, but remember that I couldn’t play Minecraft for almost a year (From December 2019 to yesterday), so in between, I deleted Minecraft. And because I had it deleted and didn’t keep it, I can’t switch back to the old edition for some stupid reason that I will never know, because apparently whoever had the idea thought, “fuck it let’s only let people who have had the game installed ever since the update play the old edition.” I don’t understand why they couldn’t just let everybody play the old edition. And speaking of that, I’m also pissed how they removed mini-games. It was one of the only other fun things of Minecraft, and of course as PlayStation players would know (and maybe other consoles), Servers are “coming soon.” And all this has happened since Microsoft joined the production. I also heard that Minecraft players will need a Microsoft account now to play Minecraft, rather than being able to use a Minecraft account. It’s like Sony buying a game that originated from the Nintendo Switch and forcing everybody to use a PlayStation account. If anything, that’s *exactly* what it is. Yes, there are some good updates like the Nether update and the Caves & Cliffs update, but honestly other than adding new content for the worlds, the updates have sucked.\n",

      "In what relation do the Communists stand to the proletarians as a whole?\n",
      "The Communists do not form a separate party opposed to the other working-class parties.\n",
      "They have no interests separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole.\n",
      "They do not set up any sectarian principles of their own, by which to shape and mould the proletarian movement.\n",
      "The Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties by this only: 1. In the national struggles of the proletarians of the different countries, they point out and bring to the front the common interests of the entire proletariat, independently of all nationality. 2. In the various stages of development which the struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass through, they always and everywhere represent the interests of the movement as a whole.\n",
      "The Communists, therefore, are on the one hand, practically, the most advanced and resolute section of the working-class parties of every country, that section which pushes forward all others; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over the great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the line of march, the conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement.\n",
      "The immediate aim of the Communists is the same as that of all other proletarian parties: formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of political power by the proletariat.\n",
      "The theoretical conclusions of the Communists are in no way based on ideas or principles that have been invented, or discovered, by this or that would-be universal reformer.\n",
      "They merely express, in general terms, actual relations springing from an existing class struggle, from a historical movement going on under our very eyes. The abolition of existing property relations is not at all a distinctive feature of communism.\n",
      "All property relations in the past have continually been subject to historical change consequent upon the change in historical conditions.\n",
      "The French Revolution, for example, abolished feudal property in favour of bourgeois property.\n",
      "The distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of property generally, but the abolition of bourgeois property. But modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products, that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by the few.\n",
      "In this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private property.\n",
      "We Communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the right of personally acquiring property as the fruit of a man’s own labour, which property is alleged to be the groundwork of all personal freedom, activity and independence.\n",
      "Hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned property! Do you mean the property of petty artisan and of the small peasant, a form of property that preceded the bourgeois form? There is no need to abolish that; the development of industry has to a great extent already destroyed it, and is still destroying it daily.\n",
      "Or do you mean the modern bourgeois private property?\n",
      "But does wage-labour create any property for the labourer? Not a bit. It creates capital, i.e., that kind of property which exploits wage-labour, and which cannot increase except upon condition of begetting a new supply of wage-labour for fresh exploitation. Property, in its present form, is based on the antagonism of capital and wage labour. Let us examine both sides of this antagonism.\n",
      "To be a capitalist, is to have not only a purely personal, but a social status in production. Capital is a collective product, and only by the united action of many members, nay, in the last resort, only by the united action of all members of society, can it be set in motion.\n",
      "Capital is therefore not only personal; it is a social power.\n",
      "When, therefore, capital is converted into common property, into the property of all members of society, personal property is not thereby transformed into social property. It is only the social character of the property that is changed. It loses its class character.\n",
      "Let us now take wage-labour.\n",
      "The average price of wage-labour is the minimum wage, i.e., that quantum of the means of subsistence which is absolutely requisite to keep the labourer in bare existence as a labourer. What, therefore, the wage-labourer appropriates by means of his labour, merely suffices to prolong and reproduce a bare existence. We by no means intend to abolish this personal appropriation of the products of labour, an appropriation that is made for the maintenance and reproduction of human life, and that leaves no surplus wherewith to command the labour of others. All that we want to do away with is the miserable character of this appropriation, under which the labourer lives merely to increase capital, and is allowed to live only in so far as the interest of the ruling class requires it.\n",
      "In bourgeois society, living labour is but a means to increase accumulated labour. In Communist society, accumulated labour is but a means to widen, to enrich, to promote the existence of the labourer.\n",
      "In bourgeois society, therefore, the past dominates the present; in Communist society, the present dominates the past. In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person is dependent and has no individuality.\n",
      "And the abolition of this state of things is called by the bourgeois, abolition of individuality and freedom! And rightly so. The abolition of bourgeois individuality, bourgeois independence, and bourgeois freedom is undoubtedly aimed at.\n",
      "By freedom is meant, under the present bourgeois conditions of production, free trade, free selling and buying.\n",
      "But if selling and buying disappears, free selling and buying disappears also. This talk about free selling and buying, and all the other “brave words” of our bourgeois about freedom in general, have a meaning, if any, only in contrast with restricted selling and buying, with the fettered traders of the Middle Ages, but have no meaning when opposed to the Communistic abolition of buying and selling, of the bourgeois conditions of production, and of the bourgeoisie itself.\n",
      "You are horrified at our intending to do away with private property. But in your existing society, private property is already done away with for nine-tenths of the population; its existence for the few is solely due to its non-existence in the hands of those nine-tenths. You reproach us, therefore, with intending to do away with a form of property, the necessary condition for whose existence is the non-existence of any property for the immense majority of society.\n",
      "In one word, you reproach us with intending to do away with your property. Precisely so; that is just what we intend.\n",
      "From the moment when labour can no longer be converted into capital, money, or rent, into a social power capable of being monopolised, i.e., from the moment when individual property can no longer be transformed into bourgeois property, into capital, from that moment, you say, individuality vanishes.\n",
      "You must, therefore, confess that by “individual” you mean no other person than the bourgeois, than the middle-class owner of property. This person must, indeed, be swept out of the way, and made impossible.\n",
      "Communism deprives no man of the power to appropriate the products of society; all that it does is to deprive him of the power to subjugate the labour of others by means of such appropriations.\n",
      "It has been objected that upon the abolition of private property, all work will cease, and universal laziness will overtake us.\n",
      "According to this, bourgeois society ought long ago to have gone to the dogs through sheer idleness; for those of its members who work, acquire nothing, and those who acquire anything do not work. The whole of this objection is but another expression of the tautology: that there can no longer be any wage-labour when there is no longer any capital.\n",
      "All objections urged against the Communistic mode of producing and appropriating material products, have, in the same way, been urged against the Communistic mode of producing and appropriating intellectual products. Just as, to the bourgeois, the disappearance of class property is the disappearance of production itself, so the disappearance of class culture is to him identical with the disappearance of all culture.\n",
      "That culture, the loss of which he laments, is, for the enormous majority, a mere training to act as a machine.\n",
      "But don’t wrangle with us so long as you apply, to our intended abolition of bourgeois property, the standard of your bourgeois notions of freedom, culture, law, &c. Your very ideas are but the outgrowth of the conditions of your bourgeois production and bourgeois property, just as your jurisprudence is but the will of your class made into a law for all, a will whose essential character and direction are determined by the economical conditions of existence of your class.\n",
      "The selfish misconception that induces you to transform into eternal laws of nature and of reason, the social forms springing from your present mode of production and form of property – historical relations that rise and disappear in the progress of production – this misconception you share with every ruling class that has preceded you. What you see clearly in the case of ancient property, what you admit in the case of feudal property, you are of course forbidden to admit in the case of your own bourgeois form of property.\n",
      "Abolition [Aufhebung] of the family! Even the most radical flare up at this infamous proposal of the Communists.\n",
      "On what foundation is the present family, the bourgeois family, based? On capital, on private gain. In its completely developed form, this family exists only among the bourgeoisie. But this state of things finds its complement in the practical absence of the family among the proletarians, and in public prostitution.\n",
      "The bourgeois family will vanish as a matter of course when its complement vanishes, and both will vanish with the vanishing of capital.\n",
      "Do you charge us with wanting to stop the exploitation of children by their parents? To this crime we plead guilty.\n",
      "But, you say, we destroy the most hallowed of relations, when we replace home education by social.\n",
      "And your education! Is not that also social, and determined by the social conditions under which you educate, by the intervention direct or indirect, of society, by means of schools, &c.? The Communists have not invented the intervention of society in education; they do but seek to alter the character of that intervention, and to rescue education from the influence of the ruling class.\n",
      "The bourgeois clap-trap about the family and education, about the hallowed co-relation of parents and child, becomes all the more disgusting, the more, by the action of Modern Industry, all the family ties among the proletarians are torn asunder, and their children transformed into simple articles of commerce and instruments of labour.\n",
      "But you Communists would introduce community of women, screams the bourgeoisie in chorus.\n",
      "The bourgeois sees his wife as a mere instrument of production. He hears that the instruments of production are to be exploited in common, and, naturally, can come to no other conclusion than that the lot of being common to all will likewise fall to the women.\n",
      "He has not even a suspicion that the real point aimed at is to do away with the status of women as mere instruments of production.\n",
      "For the rest, nothing is more ridiculous than the virtuous indignation of our bourgeois at the community of women which, they pretend, is to be openly and officially established by the Communists. The Communists have no need to introduce community of women; it has existed almost from time immemorial.\n",
      "Our bourgeois, not content with having wives and daughters of their proletarians at their disposal, not to speak of common prostitutes, take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other’s wives.\n",
      "Bourgeois marriage is, in reality, a system of wives in common and thus, at the most, what the Communists might possibly be reproached with is that they desire to introduce, in substitution for a hypocritically concealed, an openly legalised community of women. For the rest, it is self-evident that the abolition of the present system of production must bring with it the abolition of the community of women springing from that system, i.e., of prostitution both public and private.\n",
      "The Communists are further reproached with desiring to abolish countries and nationality.\n",
      "The working men have no country. We cannot take from them what they have not got. Since the proletariat must first of all acquire political supremacy, must rise to be the leading class of the nation, must constitute itself the nation, it is so far, itself national, though not in the bourgeois sense of the word.\n",
      "National differences and antagonism between peoples are daily more and more vanishing, owing to the development of the bourgeoisie, to freedom of commerce, to the world market, to uniformity in the mode of production and in the conditions of life corresponding thereto.\n",
      "The supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still faster. United action, of the leading civilised countries at least, is one of the first conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat.\n",
      "In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another will also be put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.\n",
      "The charges against Communism made from a religious, a philosophical and, generally, from an ideological standpoint, are not deserving of serious examination.\n",
      "Does it require deep intuition to comprehend that man’s ideas, views, and conception, in one word, man’s consciousness, changes with every change in the conditions of his material existence, in his social relations and in his social life?\n",
      "What else does the history of ideas prove, than that intellectual production changes its character in proportion as material production is changed? The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class.\n",
      "When people speak of the ideas that revolutionise society, they do but express that fact that within the old society the elements of a new one have been created, and that the dissolution of the old ideas keeps even pace with the dissolution of the old conditions of existence.\n",
      "When the ancient world was in its last throes, the ancient religions were overcome by Christianity. When Christian ideas succumbed in the 18th century to rationalist ideas, feudal society fought its death battle with the then revolutionary bourgeoisie. The ideas of religious liberty and freedom of conscience merely gave expression to the sway of free competition within the domain of knowledge.\n",
      "“Undoubtedly,” it will be said, “religious, moral, philosophical, and juridical ideas have been modified in the course of historical development. But religion, morality, philosophy, political science, and law, constantly survived this change.”\n",
      "“There are, besides, eternal truths, such as Freedom, Justice, etc., that are common to all states of society. But Communism abolishes eternal truths, it abolishes all religion, and all morality, instead of constituting them on a new basis; it therefore acts in contradiction to all past historical experience.”\n",
      "What does this accusation reduce itself to? The history of all past society has consisted in the development of class antagonisms, antagonisms that assumed different forms at different epochs.\n",
      "But whatever form they may have taken, one fact is common to all past ages, viz., the exploitation of one part of society by the other. No wonder, then, that the social consciousness of past ages, despite all the multiplicity and variety it displays, moves within certain common forms, or general ideas, which cannot completely vanish except with the total disappearance of class antagonisms.\n",
      "The Communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations; no wonder that its development involved the most radical rupture with traditional ideas.\n",
      "But let us have done with the bourgeois objections to Communism.\n",
      "We have seen above, that the first step in the revolution by the working class is to raise the proletariat to the position of ruling class to win the battle of democracy.\n",
      "The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degree, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralise all instruments of production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the proletariat organised as the ruling class; and to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible.\n",
      "Of course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property, and on the conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures, therefore, which appear economically insufficient and untenable, but which, in the course of the movement, outstrip themselves, necessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionising the mode of production.\n",
      "These measures will, of course, be different in different countries.\n",
      "Nevertheless, in most advanced countries, the following will be pretty generally applicable.\n",
      "1. Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes.\n",
      "2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.\n",
      "3. Abolition of all rights of inheritance.\n",
      "4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.\n",
      "5. Centralisation of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly.\n",
      "6. Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State.\n",
      "7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan.\n",
      "8. Equal liability of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.\n",
      "9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country.\n",
      "10. Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children’s factory labour in its present form. Combination of education with industrial production, &c, &c.\n",
      "When, in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the hands of a vast association of the whole nation, the public power will lose its political character. Political power, properly so called, is merely the organised power of one class for oppressing another. If the proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled, by the force of circumstances, to organise itself as a class, if, by means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling class, and, as such, sweeps away by force the old conditions of production, then it will, along with these conditions, have swept away the conditions for the existence of class antagonisms and of classes generally, and will thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class.\n",
      "In place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and class antagonisms, we shall have an association, in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all\n",

I was in a pathetic state. I was overweight, unhygienic, antisocial, and carried a very despicable attitude towards life. I looked down upon those who seemed socially successful and used gaming as an escape from the real world. I had little to no friends, maybe one or two close friends who were in the same playing field. With time, however, I transformed. Throughout high school I took the right steps to develop myself and became extremely outgoing, a social person, someone everyone knows, and someone a lot of people like. Now, I would say I have a very developed social life and am happy where I am.

You're validating your insecurities, not solving them. You're worsening your issues, not solving them. You become your worst enemy. You become the one holding yourself back, because you make the excuses to do so. Every time you use your self-perception as a reason to avoid a social situation, you're subconsciously affirming that kind of reaction and digging a deeper hole for yourself.\n",

      "Stop that. Be happier with yourself. We all have flaws, and there are some that can be fixed, but always have a happy disposition when it comes to how you perceive yourself. If there are things you can change to improve yourself, recognize them, and work towards fixing them, not shitting on yourself because you aren't where you want to be. With anything you can't change, flush it down the damn toilet and move past it. By being unhappy and negative about your self-image, you're making everything much worse.\n",

You need to become that way. It will be difficult, and there will be times where you just feel like nothing's working. But, trust me, the more you accept yourself and work towards being happy and confident, the better you appear to others. I know a guy who looks like a damn doorknob, but thanks to the work he put in himself (he has a great body, and fitness is something I will discuss later that's very important), and his insane confidence, he fucked the hottest girl at a neighboring school. A lot of people, including me, were in complete shock, but his confidence and security is what got him the prize.\n",

He's good-looking, confident, funny as hell, life of the party, and everyone knows him and loves him. Weirdly, he would often start talking to me and making jokes and trying to befriend me; that's just his personality. I decided to open up to him and moved next to him and the other soccer players and we basically ran the class and messed around and had fun. Soon enough, he took my number and invited me to my first high school party. I didn't even initiate, all I did was be friendly to him to keep something going. I went to my first high school party, opened up numerous social opportunities, and befriended a very popular person. And all I did was be open and friendly. But at all times, be honest. Don't fake your personality or lie to try to attract others or keep people by you.

Now, I'm not saying drop them entirely (wtf man I spent 2 grand on this PC), but it shouldn't be such a damn timesink. Start doing productive things that will benefit you intellectually, and healthwise. Start reading books, take up a new hobby, try something new, go out of your comfort zone. Start prioritizing things that actually matter, like your grades, your health, or your friends and family. Then, start acting on them. Start working out, start eating healthier. Study more, keep your grades up and get help if you need it. Show attention to your family, the friends you have, and open yourselves up to others.  Leading a healthy life and devoting your time to important aspects of your life that benefit you is extremely important to leading a socially successful life. After all, how are you going to open up a conversation about your 6 win-streak in CS:GO last night? How are you even going to get to that point of opening up conversation if you don't focus on yourself and other aspects of your life if you focus all that time on something unhealthy.

      "Probably the most important transition of my life came in 8th grade. I was an academic student, straight A's, that kinda thing. However, I never really did anything other than school up until 8th grade. I decided to join a few clubs to prepare myself for high school, specifically Science Olympiad and the football team. And I can't even begin to describe, looking back, how much those decisions affected me today. \n",

I started to develop acquaintances at first, and they would go on to become good friends. By joining Science Olympiad, I was **forced** to meet people and socialize with them. What a lot of people fear is the whole factor of just going up to random people and trying to make friends with them. Joining a club eliminated the anxiety behind that because it was obligatory to get to know your team members. It became a medium of friendship and the foundation of my social circles.\n",

      "But, a concern that may come to your mind is that you might not have any special skill or talent that may align with a club. Well, it doesn't matter, you should still try things out. GO OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE. This is what my decision to join the football team in 8th grade became. Mind you, I was a 120 pound scrawny Indian kid with *absolutely* no athleticism, coordination, or skill. Some of the kids on the team were monstrous freaks, lifting daily, and others had been playing the sport since they were 5. I was horrendously bad I couldn't even describe it in words. One way to visualize it is that as a 120 pound, 5' 6\" kid, I was put on the offensive line. That's where they put all the bad players and I was so bad they didn't even consider my size.\n",

      "Sounds horrible, right? It may seem like it, but all in all it was probably one of the most hilarious and also positive experiences of my life. Yes, I got shit on for being bad, but at the same time I spun it in a positive light. I became the team clown, who always fucked around and made people laugh. Even if they were laughing at my ability, I didn't care because I was having fun. By doing this, not only did I make friendships because of my likability and lack of insecurity, but I also got to experience all the ups and downs of a team sport. When I say I was the team clown, it doesn't mean I didn't have my emotional moments or times when I felt like \"wow, I'm bad, why couldn't I be better\". But all those moments and experiences with others developed me as a person and help built my character. People saw me differently than that nerdy Indian kid who had no friends. I had a personality to my name. On top of all that character building, I made friends, I became more social, and it was all automatic because I decided to join that club.\n",

Shower everyday using soap (I prefer body wash) and shampoo and condition whatever fits your hair (for me, my hair feels nasty if I don't shampoo and condition everyday). Brush your teeth twice a day, floss at least once. USE FACEWASH AND MOISTURIZER. Seriously, if you don't have acne already, help prevent it, and if you have acne it's a requirement. Use hair products to give yourself a unique hairstyle, the messy hair down look is out of style. Maintain your facial hair. If you have a pedo-stache, shave it. If you have awkward patches of facial hair, shave them. Facial hair can really make or break someone's face, and definitely don't let it be the latter. And most of all, WEAR DEODORANT.

Now I look back and thank myself so much for doing that, because I was FAT AS FUCK. People who've known me since still bring up \"dude remember when you were fat\" and it gives me a big self-esteem boost.

If your school is like mine, we even have our own workout room with benches and racks so you can workout there. DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE GYM.

      "A lot of people, at least on this sub, seem to glorify the idea of always dressing nice and looking fancy at all times. Although wearing a nice outfit to school surely makes you look fly, it's not something you need to do on a daily basis. Moreso, you should be focused on getting a standard wardrobe of t-shirts, shirts, shoes and bottoms that are in style and you can make a bunch of comfortable, yet stylish outfits. What you need to stop doing, though, is wearing graphic filled t-shirts with cargo shorts and old sneakers.   You can tell a lot by what someone's wearing, and you don't want someone's first impression of you to be judged negatively by the clothes you're wearing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here's my recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "T-shirts - Minimalist is the way to go. Get t-shirts with little to no graphics, maybe a logo, maybe a college t-shirt. Stripes work, pocket t-shirts are in style, and most of all make sure the t-shirt fits. Unless you're a /r/streetware boi don't get over-sized t-shirts. Still, stick to your own style and preferences\n",
      "\n",
      "Shirts - Get a mixture of standard long-sleeve shirts, sweaters, dress shirts, and nice button-ups like oxfords. These shirts go a long way not only for school but other activities and events as well. Again, maintain the minimalist mindset save for a few exceptions\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottoms - STOP WITH THE CARGOS. NO MORE CARGOS. Cargos are completely out of style, and only should be worn for their utility (which is rare). Stick to flat-front shorts and khakis. Basketball shorts are fine, and overall athletic shorts are good. Sweat pants and sweat shorts are always a great comfort pick and you can still make some decent outfits. Jeans are a classic, and you can't go wrong wearing them with a lot of stuff. Jeans are great! Personally I don't really find them that comfortable though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shoes - Basic black Nike's/sneakers - doesn't need to be expensive, could be Kohl's shoes. Try to get a pair of white shoes you can wear with all outfits, like Van Authentic whites or Stan Smiths. Sperries are awesome, and they look great with summer outfits and a lot of outfits in general. Other than that, you can get shoes based on your needs (e.g. dress shoes)\n",
      "\n",
      "I hate to say it, but you don't want to wear clothes that make you stand out too much. Unless an outfit is so nice you look spectacular, you don't want to come to school attracting attention to your camo cargo shorts and power rangers t-shirt. This is the one aspect of social improvement where you might need to stretch your preferences, that's just the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conversation**\n",
      "\n",
      "This is something I feel people in this sub have the most trouble with. The idea of holding a conversation with someone random can be really fucking intimidating. Breaking it down from experience, it happens like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "You see someone interesting and you want to get to know them. So you muster up the confidence to walk up to them and say \"Hi, I'm bozongle. Nice to meet you.\" They reply with \"Hey bozongle, I'm harambe.\" At that moment, you freeze. You have no idea where to go from there. Your mind starts frantically looking for what to say and you start shooting down the things that come up for various reasons (it's too cheesy, that's not funny, etc.) and while this is all happening, physically you look broken. You lose focus of the conversation completely, and you distract your attention from the person you're speaking with to thinking of what to say. The anxiety shows, and you nervously laugh while after all this intense thinking you finally choose something that you've way overthought already. \"Great weather we're havin, huh??\" you say nervously, hoping for a positive response. Then, the dread sets in as the person nervously affirms what you said and the conversation dies. You then become completely discouraged and hate everything about what you did and think about how it could've gone differently and now your fear of talking to new people heightens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your experience might be similar to that, or a variety of crash-and-burn situations. Let me start off by saying, no matter what you do, or how good of a conversationalist you are, you will have times where conversations go awkward or you just can't keep it going. I have those moments all the time. And the best thing you can do, is let go of them and use them as lessons for the next time. The more you shit on yourself about one experience, the harder it makes the next one. Why? Well, for the very reason the above interaction failed: fear and overthinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "You see, we spend so much time and effort using an internal filter to decide whats right or wrong, that we forgot about being honest with ourselves, being confident, being open. We overthink so much to make sure we say the right thing, that by the time we think of something, the vibe of the conversation has gone stale. Overthinking, and fear of what to say, are the two biggest killers of any conversation. \n",
      "\n",
      "You see this discussion a lot when seeing relationship type posts, but it applies to everyday interactions in general. To become successful in holding a conversation, you need to stop that instinct to overthink, and you need to face that fear of what to say. Stop filtering what you say, say what comes to your mind. It will be the most natural flow of the conversation, and if it offends or drives off the other person, then the connection just wasn't there and you move on or try later. Stop fearing what you say, and stop trying to cater to others. By disabling this filter, you prevent yourself from losing focus and interest on the conversation at hand. The most important concept that has helped me with keeping conversations going, is to focus on the experience at hand and use your environment and what you perceive as conversation topics. If you're at a party and you see someone chugging beers, you can bring that up, maybe make a joke, laugh about it, and then talk about drinking stories or something similar. Boom, by focusing on the situation at hand rather than using your brain to think of some good topic, you just created a healthy conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you get a conversation started, another easy way to keep it going is to *listen*. Yes, seriously, stop focusing on what to say and just listen to what the other person is saying. Listen to each word and visualize what they're saying, and using that you can pick off individual things to continue the conversation. \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, a basic conversation:\n",
      "\n",
      "B: \"Hi, my name is bozongle, nice to meet you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "H: \"Hi, nice to meet you I'm harambe\" \n",
      "B: \"(Looking at the atmosphere) Well (host's name) sure knows how to throw a rager\"\n",
      "\n",
      "H: \"Yeah definitely, me and him just got out of a beer pong game\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This conversation can go multiple ways from here. You could talk about his relationship with the host, continue to talk about the liveliness of the party, talk about his beer pong game or challenge him, talk about drinking, or even change the topic. By listening to what the other person says, you can pick apart individual aspects to continue the conversation. This is called conversational threading and is something that's covered at /r/socialskills.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even with all these concepts, I still have trouble with maintaining conversations at times. And that's perfectly fine, you will have trouble and there will be awkward moments or even times where you feel like you tried your best and shit still didn't go well. Practice is what makes you better, and learning from past experiences is extremely helpful. Take the positive out of every social situation\n",
      "\n",
      "**Girls**\n",
      "\n",
      "For the dudes, this section won't be covering how to bag a chick. Cuz that's something I still have a lot of trouble with (RIP). But, I will give my two cents on girls and the sensationalism behind them. STOP putting girls on a pedestal and being intimidated by their existence. They are human beings, they are not somehow better than you in anyway. So stop glorifying them and act like they are some prize that you have no chance of obtaining. I think the most hazardous mindset is that every girl has to be one you have to date or have sexual relations with. Honestly, try to push aside the relationship aside and genuinely become friends with some girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Literally, friendzone yourself to make sure there's no wrong ideas and try to maintain friendships with girls. It can be a lot easier than maintaining a friendship with guys and they can be an immense resource of advice, social opportunities (girls get invited everywhere, and they can invite you), knowledge, and experience. Just becoming friends with girls lowers that intimidation barrier and will make it easier for you to pursue one sexually or in a relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not to say that downfalls are to be looked upon. I had a six month fucking CRAZE for one girl a year ago and I wrote all about it here on /r/teenagers. I was obsessed. Looking back, I was dumb as shit, but I also used that experience as a huge lesson for the future. Using my past experiences, I know what to avoid. \n",

      "Social skills develop through practice and learning. Use that to your advantage, don't be fearful to fail or crash and burn.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The assholes and the fake people**\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "These are the people that make being social so difficult. The people who are just rude, stuck-up, and unfriendly, and make every time you fuck up way worse than it already was. You will come across these people, and the best you can do is recognize their shitty personality and move on. Unfortunately, a lot of these people hold a lot of social value, so it's hard to come to terms with at times especially when you're trying to find more social opportunities and such, but the best you can do is just not interact with them and spare yourself the negativity. You can find a lot more people who will be friendly and open to you, so don't let them affect you. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, watch out for the damn fakes and snakes. The people who act like your best friend, but then the moment you try to hit them up, or they don't need you, they disappear into thin air. These people hurt the most, because you get all strung up thinking you've made a close friend just to find out they really don't give a shit about you or snaked you out. You need to cut these people out ASAP. It will be difficult because they've given you attention that you feel is genuine, but it is not, and you need to stop letting them take advantage of your friendliness and character. Cutting off some people were some of the best decisions I've made, even if they hurt a lot at first.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Neediness**\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Second to hygiene, this is by far the biggest social turnoff. Being desperate and needy just advertises insecurity and clinginess, and people are not attracted to either of those traits. Stop triple, quadruple, quintuple texting people if they don't respond. Stop asking and asking people for the same things. Stop making yourself seem like you NEED attention from others. You will have the instinct to do so, because you want to be included, you want that response, you want that attention. But, if you don't get it at first, you won't get it by being needy or desperate. The best you can do is make the request, or make that move, and let the other person make their choice or decision. If they decide against it, respect their decision. DO NOT try to change their mind by acting desperate, do not try to get your way. That's not how the world works. The feeling has to be mutual, or there is no feeling at all. If someone doesn't respond to your text, you can maybe double text or call them. But if it still doesn't do anything, it's up to them, and if they decide not to reply or ignore you, it's time to move on. By not being needy you are showing your self-worth and making it clear to people that if they don't want to interact with you, so be it. Security in oneself is extremely attractive, and not being needy is the most important thing to show that besides being confident in your skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "I used to be extremely needy, I would write paragraphs to girls apologizing, or write 5 or 6 texts in a row if someone wouldn't respond. Looking back, none of that helped my case, only made it much worse. Now, I ensure that if someone doesn't have the plain respect to respond to me, or a girl doesn't share feelings for me, or any social situation where it isn't reciprocated, I am not desperate for that validation. Neediness automatically subverts you to the will of that other person, and does not make you look attractive at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Being a fuckin boss**\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After you've developed a foundation, and you've become more comfortable socially, you should always try to maintain a \"im a fucking boss attitude.\" Whenever you walk in somewhere, you should feel that you run the place. You come into a party? You better automatically be the life of that party. Come in hyped as shit, introduce yourselves to everyone, give everyone high fives, start the party games, etc. Be the symbol of fun that everyone else wants but doesn't want to stand up and do. I'm not saying be a cocky fuck. Don't act like you're inherently superior to others, just realize that you should be the one having the most fun, you should be the one running the place, you should be the life of the party. This kind of attitude brings people to you because they are naturally attracted to that kind of personality. Ever walked into a room and there's one really funny person or outgoing person that everyone pays attention to when he makes a joke or something similar? He did that by maintaining that comical mindset, by believing that he's funny as fuck. Sure, there are some who thinks that dude's annoying as shit, and there will be people that will rain on your parade. In that case, you give em the finger and continue enjoying yourself, and others will notice.\n",

      "**Be honest with yourself**\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To glaze it all, be honest with yourself. Be a little selfish, express your desires and make it clear to others what you like and don't like. If you need to, take a step back and realize what you could do to improve yourself, what you like about what you're doing, what you can change, and such. Reflecting on yourself and reassessing what you're doing is one of the best ways to progress positively. Don't fake yourself to appeal to others. Be yourself. Scratch that, be the **BEST VERSION OF YOURSELF**. Make beneficial changes for your life. The only one who can change you is you. Not me, not reddit, not the Internet, not anybody else. Only you. That means whatever makes you feel shitty now, is what you have to deal with face to face, whether it be being overweight, being awkward in social situations, not having friends, etc. YOU have to take the steps to change that. And that starts by being honest and realizing you have flaws, realizing you have stuff to do, and that's okay. Stay true to yourself and move past your flaws and start improving yourself, and stay fulfilled and always try to take the positivity over everything. That alone will make things 100x easier.\n",

      "Content: Now I know what some of you are thinking. Things like “shut up normie” and “the Instagram hate meme died out a while ago, why did you write out this whole thing?” and those are both definitely sentences, but as a person who has been using both platforms for years, I think Instagram has a solid case.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what are the main complaints levied against Instagram? First, that the memes are simple, outdated, or bad. Second, that all of the memes on instagram are stolen from reddit and reposted continuously. And last, that posters only post for likes. All of these are either oxymoronic, things reddit is also guilty of, or forgivable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll address the stealing from reddit thing and quality at first. Obviously if the memes on instagram are bad and also stolen from reddit, that would mean the memes on reddit are bad. I don’t want to spend too much time on this, because it’s probably a product of a bunch of different people creating memes about instagram separately instead of a singular idea. It’s still kinda funny though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reddit paints a picture of an infested instagram where there are only reposts. A flock of mindless scrollers who don’t know any better than to feed evil meme account owners greed for likes. This isn’t really accurate. To be honest, it fits as a description of reddit better than it does for instagram. There’s something fundamentally different about the instagram sphere that redditors who have barely used don’t it quite understand. On instagram, meme theft comes with honesty. Most repost accounts have it in their name or bio. And if you were to ask basically any of them where their memes come from, they would say “I steal them, obviously.” What’s different about reposts on instagram than reddit is that on instagram, a repost is just an attempt to share something fun they found. Redditors are looking at all this open faced reposting with horror like European colonists thinking Native-Americans are savages for basic cultural differences like matriarchy and not having the concept of land ownership. Sure, this way you don’t see quite as many original memes(which we don’t actually have definitive numbers on. It will depend on which people you follow/which subs you use), but  the reposts are sneakily slid into your feed and presenting themselves as original.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereas on Reddit, reposts and karma whore have been made public enemy number one. There's an entire elaborate system where the best content is supposed to float to the top. Karma requirements for posting and superiority complexes  give people actual motivation to repost and karma whore. On instagram, a like has remained just that. It means you liked the post. But on reddit, an upvote is an obedience to a failing system. On reddit, it’s your duty to upvote good posts and downvote bad ones. There have been good attempts to identify memes with bots and moderation, but the average user does not check the comments of every post and by the time a bot gets called the post is usually on hot already. Also, having such a transparent system for a popular post just makes it easier for karma whores to adapt to what people like. On instagram I immediately know when I’m looking at something resembling karma-whoring because karma-whores are still using minion meme “send to ten people or else” tactics. On reddit karma whores adapt to new formats and trends. Entire subreddits(r/trebuchetmemes for instance) have been consumed because the format for a popular post is so simple and adaptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s good about reddit is the niche communities. It’s nice to talk about your favorite shows and books. It *was* nice to make memes about Trebuchets and Pewdiepie and the PSAT, but Reddit destroyed those. Niches communities are getting smaller and smaller. When a cool new cartoon comes out the subreddit caps out at a couple thousand users. I just want to look at memes and be part of a community without being lied to.\n",

      "\n",
      "\\- Clubs also do better things from what I’ve heard\n",

      "\n",
      "\\- This is mostly a math and science focused high school - I do plan to go into medicine and become some type of doctor\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- This school is wayyy smaller than school A, like less than 1000 students compared to school A’s 2000 students - my mom says this is the reason they have better test scores, since more students are motivated at this school since they go here to specifically study their passion of math or science (my mom also says the placement tests they do filter out students who underperform in academics)\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- The school is also very academic-based, so that might contribute to higher test scores - because school A is open to all students, it’s more likely to have students who score lesson tests since there are other focuses for students and many different situations that could prevent students from performing well\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- No sports teams, only some extracurriculars, mostly related to math and science (robotics, Science Olympiad, Math Olympiad) - I will point out that there Science Olympiad team does worse compared to school A\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- Everything is automatically an honors course - the way a senior described it to me was that it’s basically all AP classes, so it impresses colleges\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- Very few choices in classes - you only get to choose if you want to take Calc or Statistics and if you want to take bio, chem, or physics (this is all in later years, not freshman year - everything in freshman year is chosen except for elective, which the only options are orchestra, band, choir, and art)\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- The choices thing is not particularly important to me since I have a hard time making decisions anyway and don’t mind everything being planned\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- There is more advanced college content compared to school A - impresses colleges\n",

      "\n",
      "\\- There is an IB program that lasts two years, compared to the regular 1 year AP programs\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- There is 10 minute passing time between classes - school A has 5 minute\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- School ends at 2:35 pm - school A ends at 2:10\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

So, there is almost always a Spanish and French class, but the other languages are less popular. These classes give you high school credits if you go to a public school, like school A. You can also get extra credits in math if you are in honors, which I am. I was in 7/8 honors and tested out of algebra one.

      "It's college REJECTION week and also spring break and I've received nothing but bad news and quite frankly I'm *this* close to going on r/chanceme to get chanced for my local community college. This is the most frustrating and ridiculous thing ever. Like, gee, colleges, sorry I'm the son of GOD, I'm not PERFECT. Honestly, fuck need-aware schools. Like, that's just rude. You know, I was told affirmative action would get me to the top, I'm not seeing any of the results I wished for. Friday is the next round of REJECTIONS and I hear back from my top choice on Saturday which is great so I can spend my entire weekend CRYING and go back to school on Monday and tell everyone that I'm committing to some other shit school because I can't even get into one good damn college. The disappointment is what I live for. It's great. tbh the college application process is just ELECTRIFYING. That's the word. ELECTRIFYING. I *love* sitting in front of my laptop all day waiting for some damn email to tell my decision is ready in the applicant portal and all it fucking says is \"we regret to inform you...\" BOI YOU DON'T REGRET IT. If you regret it, why are you rejecting me? accept me?????? Honestly I wish I could be content with the state school I got into and just go there and never go anywhere with my education and spend 7 years after college finding a job because I went to some trash school. But I just so happen to be friends with all these bright and successful young minds, and I just CANT COMPETE because I'm DUMB and suck at CALCULUS and we probably have a QUIZ when we get back from break. Unrelated but screw math it;s so damn hard I hate it why the kjch ;jaijc w ugh god I'm so  m mad \n",

      "Content: Just posting this writeup here because I believe it's important for a lot of people to know the truth about nuclear energy and how it isn't as harmful as many people believe.  The original article I wrote can be found [here](https://tester2080.xyz/articles/Nuclear_Fission_15-09-21.html)\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll be covering a few different concerns and topics related to nuclear energy, such as:\n",
      "1. Safety\n",
      "2. Efficiency\n",
      "3. Waste\n",
      "4. Feasibility\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Safety\n",
      "When people think about nuclear energy, they usually instantly think of accidents such as Chernobyl and Fukushima and the risks associated with a nuclear meltdown.  This causes people to write of nuclear power as dangerous and not worth it.  However, this couldn't be further from the truth.  In reality, nuclear meltdowns, especially ones that end up doing any harm, are incredibly rare.\n",
      "> Apart from Chernobyl, no nuclear workers or members of the public have ever died as a result of exposure to radiation due to a commercial nuclear reactor incident. Most of the serious radiological injuries and deaths that occur each year (2-4 deaths and many more exposures above regulatory limits) are the result of large uncontrolled radiation sources, such as abandoned medical or industrial equipment. (There have also been a number of accidents in experimental reactors and in one military plutonium-producing pile – at Windscale, UK, in 1957 – but none of these resulted in loss of life outside the actual plant, or long-term environmental contamination.\n",
      "> There have been two major reactor accidents in the history of civil nuclear power – Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi. Chernobyl involved an intense fire without provision for containment, and Fukushima Daiichi severely tested the containment, allowing some release of radioactivity. \n",
      "\n",
      "> These are the only major accidents to have occurred in over 18,500 cumulative reactor-years of commercial nuclear power operation in 36 countries. [1]\n",
      "\n",
      "2 major accidents in 18,500 reactor-years is *incredibly* low.  Imagine if there was a single reactor built.  If that had the same probability of meltdown as the average of all nuclear reactors so far, it would take 9,250 years for an accident to occur.  The pyramids were built 4,691 years ago.  If the Egyptians had built a modern nuclear reactor, it would likely still not have experienced a meltdown, and wouldn't for another 4,559 years.  The FAA estimates there to be 25,506,000 flight hours per year [20].  In 2019 there were 86 plane crashes [21].  This works out to be around 3.37176 crashes per million flight hours.  Comparatively, in total there have been 162,060,000 reactor hours and 2 main accidents.  This works out to be 0.01234 accidents per million reactor hours or 273.24 times less likely for an accident to occur from a nuclear reactor than a plane per operating hour.  Nuclear plants are similar to plane crashes in the way that they are incredibly rare, and therefore every accident sees major coverage.  Just as you hear about every plane crash but not every car crash and therefore planes seem less safe than they are, you hear about every nuclear reactor accident but not every person who dies from fossil-fuel related pollution, or other deaths involved in the production of non-renewable energy, therefore making nuclear power seem less safe.  Furthermore, the probability of a nuclear meltdown occurring is much higher when you include accidents, such as Chernobyl, which occurred in the 1980s, when safety was not as prioritised and therefore skews the current probability of a nuclear accident.  It would be like including accidents from back in the 40s when assessing the probability of a plane crash nowadays.  However, due to the low number of nuclear power plants and exceptionally low number of accidents, a more accurate figure is difficult to calculate.  However, the risk of any nuclear accident occurring today is *incredibly* low.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, accidents are far from the only way producing power kills people.  Air pollution, which largely comes from fossil fuels, kill over 5 million people a year, contributing to 9% of global deaths, and making it 4th highest contributor to deaths a year [2].  When you compare 5 million a year to the approximate 5,000 deaths overall from nuclear energy, the deaths from nuclear power seem incredibly low.  Whilst obviously we must strive to reach 0 deaths, this is impossible with current technology.  Air pollution resulting directly from fossil fuels is estimated to cause 4.5 million premature deaths a year [3].  The total electricity generation from fossil fuels is approximately 136,761TWh per year [4].  Given that (including accidents) nuclear power causes 0.07 deaths per TWh [1], if you replaced all fossil fuel electricity generation with nuclear power, approximately 9,573 people would die a year from all nuclear power related causes (mining, accidents, etc).  This means that approximately 4.5 *million* people a year would not die that would have died had fossil fuels been used.  That means that despite nuclear power being heavily opposed by the general public [5], the use of nuclear power would actively save *millions* of lives a year.  \n",
      "\n",
      "That brings us on to our next point.  You may have looked at the safety graph and are thinking \"well solar only kills 0.02 people/TWh and wind is only 0.04/TWh, compared to 0.07/TWh [1] - so why would we use nuclear?  Why not just use solar and wind, after all, they kill less people.\"  However, scaling up to a planetary (or even country-wide) level is really where ordinary renewables start to fail.  \n",
      "\n",
      "> Solar and wind power alone can’t scale up fast enough to generate the vast amounts of electricity that will be needed by midcentury, especially as we convert car engines and the like from fossil fuels to carbon-free energy sources. Even Germany’s concerted recent effort to add renewables—the most ambitious national effort so far—was nowhere near fast enough. A global increase in renewables at a rate matching Germany’s peak success would add about 0.7 trillion kilowatt-hours of clean electricity every year. That’s just over a fifth of the necessary 3.3 \n",
      "trillion annual target. \n",
      "\n",
      "> To put it another way, even if the world were as enthusiastic and technically capable as Germany at the height of its renewables buildup—and neither of these is even close to true in the great majority of countries—decarbonizing the world at that rate would take nearly *150 years*. [6]\n",
      "The storage of all the renewable power would also be an issue\n",
      "\n",
      ">  Bill Gates, who has invested $1 billion in renewables, notes that “there’s no battery technology that’s even close to allowing us to take all of our energy from renewables.” [6]\n",
      "\n",
      "> Our analysis demonstrates that realising nuclear energy's potential is essential to achieving a deeply decarbonised energy future in many regions of the world [7]\n",
      "\n",
      ">  While we are installing renewables at record speeds, at the same time the amount of fossil fuels we’re burning for electricity still keeps rising year by year. Renewables have, so far, not been able to catch up with the demand for new electricity and so despite our progress, emissions from electricity are still rising world wide. [8]\n",
      "\n",
      "It becomes rather clear when you look at Germany, which has been actively removing nuclear power plants.  Despite building huge amounts of renewable plants, they still get 49.5% of their energy from non-renewable sources [9]. Compare that to countries like \"France and Sweden: In France, only around 10% comes from fossil fuels, while 67% comes from nuclear and 23% from renewables, primarily hydro [10]. In Sweden almost 30% comes from nuclear power, and almost 45% from hydro [11]. So we know that nuclear energy can work at scale.\"[12].  These countries clearly show how nuclear can be used alongside renewables to get the maximum benefit of both.  Renewables on their own are not enough to power the entire grid, as they have periods where they must go offline.  For example, wind and solar can only produce maximum power for 35.4% and 24.9% of the year respectively [13].  This means that the other 65+% of the time, energy must be taken out of batteries if we were to just use wind and solar.  This is not feasible.  However, compare those percentages to the incredibly high 92.5% of the year where nuclear power plants can produce maximum power [13].  Therefore, by having both nuclear and other renewables, nuclear can easily supplement the power generation when other renewables cannot.  The only other power source close to nuclear's capacity factor is geothermal (74.3% [13]) however, that is not a feasible method of energy generation in most countries. Furthermore, nuclear plants are *incredibly* efficient.  It is estimated that 1 pound of uranium can provide as much energy as 5,000 barrels of oil [24].  Regardless of how safe you believe nuclear power plants to be, if you want to stop climate change by powering the grid cleanly, they *must* be used.  \n",
      "\n",
      "When people think of nuclear reactors and the downsides, nuclear waste is a very common thing to be cited.  However, 97% of the waste is low or intermediate level waste (90% and 7% respectively) and storage of it is not much of an issue [14].  The idea that we don't have any idea of what to do with the remaining 3% is untrue, \"Safe methods for the final disposal of high-level radioactive waste are technically proven; the international consensus is that geological disposal is the best option.\"[15] \"The concept of final storage in deep geological formations has become established as a means of safe radwaste management in order to ensure lasting protection against radioactive waste for people and for the environment. This method allows the radioactive waste to be kept away from human living environments in the long term – i.e. for many millennia.\" [16] \"There is a common solution to the challenges of ensuring long term safety for spent fuel and of preventing weapon grade materials being illegally diverted and misused. Deep geologic repositories are the answer. The paper describes the specific engineering, geological, hydrogeological and geotechnical challenges involved at each phase in the development of a geologic repository.\" [17]  In the incredibly rare scenario where there has been a leak, it has not caused any significant harm.  In 2014 a leak was detected in a repository in New Mexico. 13 workers tested positive for radiation and even though every radiation level above zero is worth investigating, the radiation exposure was ten times less radiation than that delivered during a typical chest X-ray. [17]  It is clear that safe storage of nuclear waste is not much of a problem, with the only issue being with potentially the amount of space it takes up, however, currently the amount of high level waste is \"12,000 tonnes worldwide every year, which is the equivalent of a two-storey structure built on a basketball court or about 100 double-decker buses and is modest compared with other industrial wastes.\"[14].  A lot of this HLW can be reprocessed \"As of 2013 approximately 370,000 tons have been generated worldwide since the first reactor was connected to the grid, of which roughly one third (124,000 tons) has been reprocessed\" [18].  For example, \"In France, where fuel is reprocessed, just 0.2% of all radioactive waste by volume is classified as high-level waste (HLW)\" [15].  Additionally nuclear recycling [22] exists and could possibly be used to further reduce nuclear waste.  However, costs for such reactors are high, and engineers in that area are rare.  Additionally, there are fears about the plutonium created being used for weapons (although such a thing being successfully carried out is very unlikely) [23].\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the many recent breakthroughs in nuclear fusion [25]\\[26] nuclear fusion is still likely at least 5 years away from reaching net energy output, and like 20 years away from feasibly being able to use it to power the entire grid.  Whilst I wholeheartedly support the advent of nuclear fusion technology and development, and believe once it powers the entire grid we should start retiring nuclear fission plants.  However, we cannot just hope that nuclear fusion or some other magic technology will swoop in and save us from climate change at the last second.  We have already gone past the point of no return - at this stage we are simply attempting damage mitigation really\n",
      "> Many changes due to past and future greenhouse gas emissions are irreversible for centuries to millennia, especially changes in the ocean, ice sheets and global sea level. [27]\n",
      "\n",
      "Nuclear fission reactors are here now.  They work.  They can feasibly stop the effects of climate change.  However, we must act now.  We must stop decommissioning nuclear plants early, and try to rapidly build new ones.  It is a race against time.\n",
      "As I have mentioned previously, renewables alone will not be enough.  And I'm not going to argue that we should go entirely nuclear either.  What we need is a mix of both.  I have shown that nuclear power is safe, effective, and necessary.  If we want to stop climate change, we cannot shy away from using one of the most powerful tools we have.  Thank you for reading.\n",

We must change the public perception of nuclear power for the better.  We must save lives by reducing air pollution.  We must save the planet.  It is an immense challenge and we need as much public support of viable climate change prevention methods as possible.\n",

      "Title: Here is a Wikipedia article I copied and pasted about sand it's course it's rough and it gets every where it's SAND\n",
      "Content: Sand is a granular material composed of finely divided rock and mineral particles. It is defined by size, being finer than gravel and coarser than silt. Sand can also refer to a textural class of soil or soil type; i.e., a soil containing more than 85 percent sand-sized particles by mass.[2]\n",
      "\n",
      "The composition of sand varies, depending on the local rock sources and conditions, but the most common constituent of sand in inland continental settings and non-tropical coastal settings is silica (silicon dioxide, or SiO2), usually in the form of quartz. The second most common type of sand is calcium carbonate, for example, aragonite, which has mostly been created, over the past half billion years, by various forms of life, like coral and shellfish. For example, it is the primary form of sand apparent in areas where reefs have dominated the ecosystem for millions of years like the Caribbean.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sand is a non-renewable resource over human timescales, and sand suitable for making concrete is in high demand.[3] Desert sand, although plentiful, is not suitable for concrete. 50 billion tons of beach sand and fossil sand is used each year for construction.[4]\n",
      "\n",
      "Composition\n",
      "\n",
      "Heavy minerals (dark) in a quartz beach sand (Chennai, India).\n",
      "\n",
      "Sand from Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park, Utah. These are grains of quartz with a hematite coating providing the orange color.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sand from Pismo Beach, California. Components are primarily quartz, chert, igneous rock, and shell fragments.\n",
      "The exact definition of sand varies. The scientific Unified Soil Classification System used in engineering and geology corresponds to US Standard Sieves,[5] and defines sand as particles with a diameter of between 0.074 and 4.75 millimeters. By another definition, in terms of particle size as used by geologists, sand particles range in diameter from 0.0625 mm (or ​1⁄16 mm) to 2 mm. An individual particle in this range size is termed a sand grain. Sand grains are between gravel (with particles ranging from 2 mm up to 64 mm by the latter system, and from 4.75 mm up to 75 mm in the former) and silt (particles smaller than 0.0625 mm down to 0.004 mm). The size specification between sand and gravel has remained constant for more than a century, but particle diameters as small as 0.02 mm were considered sand under the Albert Atterberg standard in use during the early 20th century. The grains of sand in Archimedes' The Sand Reckoner written around 240 BCE, were 0.02 mm in diameter. A 1938 specification of the United States Department of Agriculture was 0.05 mm.[6] A 1953 engineering standard published by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials set the minimum sand size at 0.074 mm. Sand feels gritty when rubbed between the fingers. Silt, by comparison, feels like flour.\n",
      "\n",
      "ISO 14688 grades sands as fine, medium, and coarse with ranges 0.063 mm to 0.2 mm to 0.63 mm to 2.0 mm. In the United States, sand is commonly divided into five sub-categories based on size: very fine sand (​1⁄16 – ​1⁄8 mm diameter), fine sand (​1⁄8 mm – ​1⁄4 mm), medium sand (​1⁄4 mm – ​1⁄2 mm), coarse sand (​1⁄2 mm – 1 mm), and very coarse sand (1 mm – 2 mm). These sizes are based on the Krumbein phi scale, where size in Φ = -log2D; D being the particle size in mm. On this scale, for sand the value of Φ varies from −1 to +4, with the divisions between sub-categories at whole numbers.\n",

      "Close up of black volcanic sand from Perissa, Santorini, Greece\n",
      "The most common constituent of sand, in inland continental settings and non-tropical coastal settings, is silica (silicon dioxide, or SiO2), usually in the form of quartz, which, because of its chemical inertness and considerable hardness, is the most common mineral resistant to weathering.\n",
      "\n",
      "The composition of mineral sand is highly variable, depending on the local rock sources and conditions. The bright white sands found in tropical and subtropical coastal settings are eroded limestone and may contain coral and shell fragments in addition to other organic or organically derived fragmental material, suggesting that sand formation depends on living organisms, too.[7] The gypsum sand dunes of the White Sands National Park in New Mexico are famous for their bright, white color. Arkose is a sand or sandstone with considerable feldspar content, derived from weathering and erosion of a (usually nearby) granitic rock outcrop. Some sands contain magnetite, chlorite, glauconite, or gypsum. Sands rich in magnetite are dark to black in color, as are sands derived from volcanic basalts and obsidian. Chlorite-glauconite bearing sands are typically green in color, as are sands derived from basaltic lava with a high olivine content. Many sands, especially those found extensively in Southern Europe, have iron impurities within the quartz crystals of the sand, giving a deep yellow color. Sand deposits in some areas contain garnets and other resistant minerals, including some small gemstones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sources\n",
      "Rocks erode or weather over a long period of time, mainly by water and wind, and their sediments are transported downstream. These sediments continue to break apart into smaller pieces until they become fine grains of sand. The type of rock the sediment originated from and the intensity of the environment gives different compositions of sand. The most common rock to form sand is granite, where the feldspar minerals dissolve faster than the quartz, causing the rock to break apart into small pieces. In high energy environments rocks break apart much faster than in more calm settings. For example, Granite rocks this means more Feldspar minerals in the sand because it wouldn't have had time to dissolve. The term for sand formed by weathering is epiclastic.[8]\n",
      "\n",
      "Sand from rivers are collected either from the river itself or its flood plain and accounts for the majority of the sand used in the construction industry. Because of this, many small rivers have been depleted, causing environmental concern and economic losses to adjacent land. The rate of sand mining in such areas greatly outweighs the rate the sand can replenish, making it a non-renewable resource.[9]\n",
      "\n",
      "Sand dunes are a consequence of dry conditions or wind deposition. The Sahara Desert is very dry because of its geographic location and is known for its vast sand dunes. They exist here because very little vegetation is able to grow and there's not a lot of water. Over time, wind blows away all the fine particles, such as clay and dead organic matter, leaving only sand and larger rocks. Only 15% of the Sahara is sand dunes, while 70% is bare rock.[10] The wind is responsible for creating these different environments and shaping the sand to be round and smooth. These properties make desert sand unusable for construction.[11]\n",
      "\n",
      "Beach sand is also formed by erosion. Over thousands of years, rocks are eroded near the shoreline from the constant motion of waves and the sediments build up. Weathering and river deposition also accelerate the process of creating a beach, along with marine animals interacting with rocks, such as eating the algae off of them. Once there is a sufficient amount of sand, the beach acts as a barrier to keep the land from eroding any further. This sand is ideal for construction as it is angular and of various sizes.[12]\n",
      "\n",
      "Marine sand (or ocean sand) comes from sediments transported into the ocean and the erosion of ocean rocks. The thickness of the sand layer varies, however it is common to have more sand closer to land; this type of sand is ideal for construction and is a very valuable commodity. Europe is the main miners of marine sand, which greatly hurts ecosystems and local fisheries.[9]\n",

      "The study of individual grains can reveal much historical information as to the origin and kind of transport of the grain.[13] Quartz sand that is recently weathered from granite or gneiss quartz crystals will be angular. It is called grus in geology or sharp sand in the building trade where it is preferred for concrete, and in gardening where it is used as a soil amendment to loosen clay soils. Sand that is transported long distances by water or wind will be rounded, with characteristic abrasion patterns on the grain surface. Desert sand is typically rounded.\n",

      "Only some sands are suitable for the construction industry, for example for making concrete. Because of the growth of population and of cities and the consequent construction activity there is a huge demand for these special kinds of sand, and natural sources are running low. In 2012 French director Denis Delestrac made a documentary called \"Sand Wars\" about the impact of the lack of construction sand. It shows the ecological and economic effects of both legal and illegal trade in construction sand.[17][18][19]\n",
      "\n",
      "To retrieve the sand, the method of hydraulic dredging is used. This works by pumping the top few meters of sand out of the water and filling it into a boat, which is then transported back to land for processing. Unfortunately, all marine life mixed in with the extracted sand is killed and the ecosystem can continue to suffer for years after the mining is complete. Not only does this affect marine life, but also the local fishing industries because of the loss of life, and communities living close to the water's edge. When sand is taken out of the water it increases the risk of landslides, which can lead to loss of agricultural land and/or damage to dwellings.[20]\n",
      "\n",
      "Sand's many uses require a significant dredging industry, raising environmental concerns over fish depletion, landslides, and flooding.[21] Countries such as China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Cambodia ban sand exports, citing these issues as a major factor.[22] It is estimated that the annual consumption of sand and gravel is 40 billion tons and sand is a US$70 billion global industry.[23]\n",
      "\n",
      "The global demand for sand in 2017 was 9.55 billion tons as part of a $99.5 billion industry.[24]\n",
      "\n",
      "Hazards\n",
      "While sand is generally non-toxic, sand-using activities such as sandblasting require precautions. Bags of silica sand used for sandblasting now carry labels warning the user to wear respiratory protection to avoid breathing the resulting fine silica dust. Safety data sheets for silica sand state that \"excessive inhalation of crystalline silica is a serious health concern\".[25]\n",
      "\n",
      "In areas of high pore water pressure, sand and salt water can form quicksand, which is a colloid hydrogel that behaves like a liquid. Quicksand produces a considerable barrier to escape for creatures caught within, who often die from exposure (not from submersion) as a result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manufacture\n",
      "Manufactured sand (M sand) is sand made from rock by artificial processes, usually for construction purposes in cement or concrete. It differs from river sand by being more angular, and has somewhat different properties.[26]\n",
      "\n",
      "Case studies\n",
      "In Dubai, United Arab Emirates, the use of sand has been very demanding in the construction of infrastructure and creating new islands. They used up their own reserves and now import most of their sand from Australia. There have been three projects to create artificial islands needing more than 835 million tonnes of sand, which cost more than US$26 billion.[27]\n",

      "Title: Essay I have for US History. Im curious on others thoughts, content or spelling, grammatical, etc. Sorry if the formatting is shit and the links don't work.\n",
      "Content: In the United States of America, we pride ourselves on our ability to be free, and our right to vote for out nations leaders. However, in this time of connection that we live in today we are growing increasingly separated because of one of the major parts of our democratic system; political parties. It is my firm belief that political parties are going to lead to the eventual downfall of America due to their demonization of all who don’t agree with them, and their increasingly extreme views, which I believe could be harboring a new civil war if it continues down the path we are on. Now that I have your attention, let’s start by proving this demonization. This is easy though, because you need to look no further than your own mind. When you think of a typical Democrat your mind will automatically go for the stereotypes; a tree hugging millennial who hates the government and yells at people about privilege. And the same thing can happen when you think of a typical Republican; a fat guy who lives on a farm, loves his guns and the holy bible, thinking women are inferior. Now if you find yourself on either side of these you may start to think that how I described your political ideologies is, and you are completely right for thinking that because while there may be people like that in your party, it’s the minority. However, when I described the opposite party, I bet there was some point when you thought ‘seems about right’ even if it was only for a second. That is a stereotype that has been cemented in your head by different media outlets and articles. That makes it so even when talking to someone who you know doesn’t fit that description, the second they mention that they stand on the opposite of the party line, your mind drifts to the stereotype and they are immediately an idiot because while they might not fit the stereotype, they agree with the stereotype. Which is a perfect segue into my next point: political parties are becoming increasingly extreme. To tackle this lets point out the number of bills passed to introduced ratio in congress. We are going to focus on the senate because the house of representatives weeds out all of the nonsense bills and then passes them on to the senate. So in the 80th Senate (1947-1948) the ratio of bills passed to bills introduced was 0.524 which has been on a steady decline until the 112th Senate (2011-2012) where the ratio was 0.097 ([Brookings.edu: Vital stats](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Vital-Statistics-Chapter-6-Legislative-Productivity-in-Congress-and-Workload_UPDATE.pdf)) This can be contributed to the decline in the ability to compromise where both parties will be happy, due to the extreme views of both. Gun laws are another perfect example for this, where Democrats want a high amount of restrictions to make getting a firearm more difficult and Republicans wanting nothing of the sort. Instead of finding a compromise they instead argue over why their side is right and don’t budge on the issue, causing nothing to get done and increasing strain between cross party relations. Which leads me to my final point, the increasing strain on cross party relations could lead to another civil war. We can see this by looking at history, leading up to the civil war there was a buildup of tension that took years to foster, then with one swoop they had enough and seceded from the US. We can see similarities happening in modern day politics as well. With each party believing that they are the moral right and believing the opposing side is evil we may very well be on the way to a second civil war if we aren’t careful. Maybe not in our lifetimes, but the buildup is visible in our everyday lives and like the first civil war it could take only one election. Finally, I would like to leave you with the logical connection in all of this and some ideas on how we can stop this. It all starts with stereotypes developing, this causes unnecessary discrimination based on politics. Then that leads into extreme unwillingness to cooperate with the opposing side due to your belief that they are inferior and attempting to distance your views from theirs as much as possible, this slowly builds up until it all comes crashing down when one side has had enough of the demonization and breaks away, leading to a second civil war. But there are steps we can take to prevent this, stereotypes can be changed and ignored entirely if you train your brain enough by talking to people with opposing views. While you don’t have to agree you can see that they are people. There is evidence that this can work, like when Daryl Davis, a black man attended KKK rallies ([Why I, as a black man, attend KKK rallies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORp3q1Oaezw)). Keep this in mind in your everyday life, start conversations. Don’t hate because you disagree with someone. As George Washington said in his farewell address “To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the whole is indispensable. No alliance, however strict, between the parts can be an adequate substitute,” ([Transcript of President George Washington’s Farewell Address](https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=false&doc=15&page=transcript))\n",

      "Content: I'll be 17 in a week in a half. Never kissed a girl. Can't say I've never wanted to, I've definitely crushed on girls many times since middle school. But yet, my social anxiety has never really let me put myself out there. I've always been the one uncomfortable at \"parties\" in middle school, always the one that was awkward. I guess that reputation followed me into high school, a sin of being in a private school.\n",
      "\n",
      "At some point, probably during freshman year, I accepted that I was going to be the awkward one in the class. I accepted I would never actually have a high school relationship. And I guess I was content with that, even though having crushes didn't exactly stop. I piled on course work and devoted myself towards grades. \n",
      "\n",
      "But this year, something changed. I didn't want to be the one left out, I wanted to be in love with someone, and them loving me back. This change probably happened because I met a girl that I crushed on harder than ever before. She's perfect. Hilarious, smart, and actually listens during a conversation. I thought she might have feelings for me too. So I worked up my courage and asked her out, something I had never done before.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess I fell into the trap of a girl having pleasurable conversation and eye contact with you doesn't mean she's into you. That's fair, that's a lesson I'll learn. She used the excuse of \"not her priority,\" no clue whether that's true or not. But either way she said no.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was a month ago. My feelings towards her should have stopped by now, but they haven't. We still talk, as we have a lot of mutual friends, but not one-on-one anymore. It hurts when I see her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought that was going to be my social low point for the year. But alas, it got worse, and it got worse within the past few days. You see, a couple months ago, I decided to join the production crew for my school's play. I like working tech and things, plus have a lot of friends that usually work crew. I thought I'd enjoy it, and I can't say that I don't enjoy running the show. But it is a time taker, a time taker now more than ever, now when I have my AP exams in a few days that I haven't found time to study for. I'm stressed out of my mind because of that.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the play hasn't helped my social situation. You see, one of the other reasons I joined it was because I could have an excuse to stay at school and away from home, where I have friends and not my family (my reasons for avoiding them is a whole different story). But all I realized while doing it is that I'm more disconnected than ever. Today is one of the performances of the show, and one of my fellow crewmates, a freshman, came up to me during school and told me about a post-production party. A party that I, of course, wasn't even talked about near. This hurt, even though it happened before, it seemed to hurt more than any other party misses. Maybe its because I tried so hard to change my image recently. I got thinner, got a better haircut, and started to dress better. But no, that didn't work. I'm pretty sure that even my friends keep news of parties from me, as I overhear them talking about something, and when I ask they just say its nothing. Am I just annoying to talk to? I guess.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it didn't get better, it got worse, even today. After that crewmate, a different friend of mine came up to me and mocked me about something I posted on Reddit in middle school. Something stupid, yes, but something that he for some reason still mocks me about. I guess it's because I never had the balls to tell him to stop, I just put on a face and laughed. And I guess that he felt like that was his call to spread it to some of my new friends, which now mock me about it to. They think it's banter, I let it be banter, I laugh. But it hurts me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then it got worse. As I was leaving school, one of my other friends came up and quickly mentioned how that girl of my dreams, the one I'm still not over, is going to a different friend's house after school. I know what happens at that house; they'll get high, and because they're high, they'll probably fuck. Two friends of mine, one of which I haven't gotten over, and the other which knows I am not over her and knows I got denied by her. I should be happy for them, after all. If they like each other, so be it, they should be happy. But this one hurts a lot. Hurts more than almost anything else, even though she said no to me. Maybe it's because its conclusive proof that it being in a relationship is not \"not one of her priorities right now\", but just doesn't like me that way. I should be ok with that, I don't want to force her to like me, and I want her to be happy. But it still fucks me up.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's also prom coming up. Everyone's asking everyone. I always say I'm not going, that I hate parties, that I don't want to be there. Perpetuating the stereotype of me that I started in middle school, even though all of those are lies now.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the lowest point in my life. I'm more stressed than ever, and more alone and socially fucked than ever. I don't want to be at home, and I don't want to be at school. I've always had one of those be my safe space, but now I have none. Meanwhile, I feel like I'm not qualified to talk about these feelings to others. Adults will say it's just hormones, which it might be. And all my friends seem to have diagnosed issues; some have ADHD, a couple clinical depression, one or two with clinical anxiety. Meanwhile, doctor's think I'm perfect It makes me feel like I can't talk to them, as I don't have those proven problems. I'm not depressed I'm just sad. I'm not having a period of ADHD I'm just tired and losing focus. I don't have socially anxiety I'm just nervous. Sometimes they say that directly, other times I just think they will.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I guess I'm back to square one. Kissless virgin till college, I'll need to reaffirm my belief in that. I guess I'm still the fat, awkward kid from middle school. My reputation seems to stay that way and my words from then still chase me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry for the wall of text, and thank you to whoever decided to spend their probably 20 minutes reading this. I just needed to write this somewhere public. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the play, I'll need to go back to school in a couple hours to work crew. But with the amount of happy faces I put on while there, I might as well be an actor.\n",

      "A saltine or soda cracker is a thin, usually square cracker made from white flour, yeast, and baking soda, with most varieties lightly sprinkled with coarse salt. It has perforations over its surface, as well as a distinctively dry and crisp texture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some familiar brand names of saltine crackers in North America are Christie's Premium Plus (Canada), Nabisco's Premium (U.S.), Sunshine Biscuits' Krispy (U.S.), Keebler's Zesta (U.S.) (both owned by Kellogg's), Molinos Modernos' Hatuey (Dominican Republic) and Noel's Saltín (Colombia). Unsalted tops as well as whole grain saltines can also be found.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soda crackers were described in \"The Young Housekeeper\" by Alcott in 1838.[1]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1876, F. L. Sommer & Company of St. Joseph, Missouri started using baking soda to leaven its wafer thin cracker. Initially called the Premium Soda Cracker and later \"Saltines\" because of the baking salt component, the invention quickly became popular and Sommer's business quadrupled within four years. That company merged with other companies to form American Biscuit Company in 1890 and then after further mergers became part of Nabisco in 1898.[2][3][4]\n",
      "\n",
      "In the early 20th century, various companies in the United States began selling soda crackers in Puerto Rico and referred to them as \"Export Soda\". Rovira Biscuit Corp. of Puerto Rico also started selling their soda crackers with the same name. The term \"Export Soda\" became a generic term in Puerto Rico for these crackers. In 1975 Keebler Co. was refused a trademark for the term because it was \"merely descriptive\".[5]\n",
      "\n",
      "In the United States, Nabisco lost trademark protection after the term \"saltine\" began to be used generically to refer to similar crackers (see generic trademark for how this occurs). The name \"saltine\" had been placed in the Merriam Webster Dictionary in 1907 with a definition of \"a thin crisp cracker usually sprinkled with salt”.[6] In Australia, Arnott's Biscuits Holdings still holds a trademark on the name \"Saltine\".[7][8]\n",

      "Saltines are commonly eaten as a light snack, often with cheese, butter, peanut butter or other spreads. They may also be dipped or crumbled in soups, chilis, stews, and eaten with, or crumbled into, salads. Typically they are sold in boxes containing two to four stacks of crackers, each wrapped in a sleeve of waxed paper or plastic. In restaurants, they are found in small wrapped plastic packets of two crackers, which generally accompany soup or salad. Cracker meal, a type of coarse to semi-fine flour made of crushed saltine crackers, may be used as toppings for various dishes; breading for fried or baked poultry, fish or red meats; or as a thickener for meatloaf, soups, stews, sauces, and chilis.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a home remedy, saltines are consumed by many people in order to ease nausea and to settle an upset stomach. Saltine crackers have also been frequently included in military field rations (Meal, Ready-to-Eat, or MRE) in the United States.\n",

      "Saltines have been compared to hardtack, a simple unleavened cracker or biscuit made from flour, water, and sometimes salt. However, unlike hardtack, saltines include yeast as one of their ingredients. Soda crackers are a leavened bread that is allowed to rise for twenty to thirty hours. After the rise, alkaline soda is added to neutralize the excessive acidity produced by the action of the yeast. The dough is allowed to rest for three to four more hours, to relax the gluten, before being rolled in layers and then baked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flat saltine crackers have perforations on their surfaces. During baking, the outer layer of dough hardens first, restricting out-gassing of evolved gasses. The perforations connect the top surface to the bottom surface to prevent the cracker from pillowing as a result of these evolved gasses.\n",

      "Hello boys, welcome, you probably clicked on this post because of the title, but first we gotta set some things straight.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is, by no means, a step-by-step guide on how to get a girl to like you/have a date, or some infallible rulebook of how to interact with someone you like, this is just a compilation of the knowledge I've gained through experience, investigation and good advice from other people that I think a lot of you need and would like to know.\n",
      "\n",
      "And before you go on all reddit-detective on me, yes, this is a fairly new account, yes, you have no reason or obligation to believe me, do what you want with the things I say and the information contained in this post. I just recently discovered this subreddit and found out a lot of you feel insecure and would like help or advice in the seemingly impossible task of interacting with the mythical creatures we only hear about in whispers known as \"females\".\n",
      "\n",
      "This post was inspired by another post in this same subreddit asking this question, and realized I could make a better, in depth guide about the topic and open discussion about the advice I want to share with you, this will be a **very long post**, but I do recommend you try reading it in it's entirety, with this out of the way, lets start.\n",
      "\n",
      "# OK then?\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember: girls are, like us (maybe) human beings, and everyone has a unique way of thinking, feeling, has different opinions, tastes and characteristics, meaning that if something works on a girl, there is no certainty it will work with other girls, so I pretend this to be a comprehensive general advice or guide to help you talk with a girl in a comfortable and more effective manner.\n",

      "# Hygene\n",
      "\n",
      "Girls smell you before they see you, seriously, a lot of girls i've talked to about the topic say the same, if they catch a whiff of a nice smellin' guy, they inmediatly turn their heads, so having general good hygene is a **must** in being likeable to a girl:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Shower or bath regularly**: you don't have to be Mr. Clean, but please keep yourself not-dirty.\n",
      "* **Use deodorant**: if possible, a good brand roll on antiperspirant, those aerosols commercials look tempting, but not only you're damaging the environment, they are generally less effective than using a good roll on antipersiprant where it matters and using cologne or perfume for the rest, but DON'T overdo it. Another no-no is thinking you can skip a bath by just putting on some cologne, **N O** believe me, it is worse to be sweaty or smelly and trying to cover it up with some body spray.\n",
      "* **Cut your nails**: having long nails is DISGUSTANG, as much as it is a useful tool in some cases, trim and clean them regularly, having long nails is a negative on the list, especially if they are dirty.\n",
      "* **Skin care is great**: Keeping your face and skin clean and soft is something a lot of girls like, would you rather hug a soft satin pillow or a coarse wool one?, regarding facial hair, this is a bit more divided, some girls like beard as a sign of masculinity, others like clean faces, so i'd just advice you to do whatever you are comfortable with, if you like you, I like you.\n",
      "* **Brush your teeth**: Having bad breath is a major turn down, brush your teeth regularly to keep them clean, floss and mouthwash, not only because of your health, but having a clean mouth is important, you don't approach a girl with morning breath or a strand of meat hanging out between your teeth, it is not a bad idea to keep a breath freshener with you just in case, but it is not by any means a replacement for oral hygene.\n",
      "* **Clean your ears and nose**: If, like me, you produce an insane amount of earwax, clean it out, ***DON'T PUT Q-TIPS IN YOUR INNER EAR***, those are meant to clean the outside of the ear, if you have internal earwax problems, consult your doctor or otorinloca- otorhinolacri- ot- you know what I mean.

      "\n",
      "* **Relax**: It is easy to get nervous and start talking incoherently, babbling and stuttering. You must remember that girls are human beings, like you they have goals, feelings, preferences etc. they are also capable of being comprehensive and empathic, if you overanalyze and start thinking \"I'm gonna f\\*ck up\" \"I can't do this\" \"Where do I even start\" you'll start spiraling out of control into embarassment or just freezing in panic. Be chill about it and try to have a little more confidence in yourself, everyone makes mistakes, so if you are calm about it, and don't give too much importance to something that doesn't have it, chances are, she won't either, maybe you can even get a laugh out of it. Breathe in and out, you don't need to learn a new language to talk to a girl (unless that girl does actually speak in some other language, duh).\n",
      "* **Don't be afraid**: She won't bite... I hope... but seriously, the thing is, a lot of you fear rejection, you don't want your friends to watch you fail or fear the embarassment that comes from it, and even if a girl rejects you or just plain avoids contact with you, the downsides are nothing in comparison to the possible reward, and sometimes, even if you don't get a date, you'll make a friend!\n",
      "* **Be casual**: If it is the first or one of the first times you talk to your \"objective\" chances are, you don't know each other, find out what she likes, ask simple and non-agressive questions. You shouldn't talk about your impressive collection of videogames or the lore of your favorite anime in the first date or interaction, keep things simple and casual, if you talk about complicated stuff, or act like \"i'm here for you, tell me anything\" you'll be uninteresting or you will end up on the friendzone (dun-dun-dun).\n",
      "* **Be polite**: It sounds like something you are taught when you were a child, but it's true, most girls dislike mean or foul-mouthed men, be polite and use a basic brain to mouth \"filter\", be chivalrous and respectful, thee needn't to talk in old english, but be careful as to what comes out of your mouth.\n",
      "* **Be sincere:** Sincerity is impressive for girls, makes it easier for them to trust you, this is both good for talking to girls and to mantain a relationship, you don't need to tell her what you do when you're home alone at 2 am in your bedroom, but being sincere when she makes you a question is certainly attractive.\n",
      "* **Be yourself**: It sounds like a cliché but *to be yourself is all that you can do,* talking to girls really isn't complicated, and it's better to have a girl like you the way you are, than by the way you appear to be, if you deviate too much from the \"real you\" you are decieving her, and like with false advertising, it ends in dissapointment.\n",
      "* **You are top priority:** we've all seen the \"simp\" memes, and if one thing we can learn from them is: you need to care for you, you need to love yourself before starting to love someone else, accept who you are, work on your self esteem and care, if you feel down talk to a friend or someone you trust, work on loving you for who you are, if you have depression or feel unwilling to try and better yourself up, talk with a professional, mental health is just as important as physical health, and sometimes you need to stop and think, if you are doing more for someone else than for yourself.\n",

      "* **Be natural**: don't be robotic or talk in a scripted way, chill, and let the words flow, if you make a mistake, as pointed out before, it's not the end of the world, maybe you can even get a laugh about it, lighten the mood, and be yourself.\n",
      "* **Good posture**: don't go walking like The Hunchback of Notre Dame, try to walk straight, head on and lean foward! walking curved down is body language for insecurity, cowardice and fear, which is definetly not attractive. Adding to it, when in a conversation, leaning ever so slightly foward makes you look more invigorated and interesting, slouching and leaning back has the opposite effect.\n",
      "* **Smile**: Smiling is scientifically proven to make you look and be happier, you'll transmit a happier and more confident and comforting aura, making it easier for women to connect with you, it makes you look more attractive and likeable. If you feel insecure about your smile or teeth, or have medical issues with them, consult a professional.\n",
      "* **Look her in the eyes**: Very important, makes you look interested and confident, you seem to be more trustworthy and easy to talk with, talking with someone that doesn't look you in the eyes is not only rude, it transmits disinterest and makes you look feel bored.\n",
      "* **Be healthy**: some studies and polls show girls don't really look for super buff, he-man like men, and being a little bit overweight isn't unattractive, but y'know, working out, eating good, and getting in good shape is a plus for most girls.\n",

And it’s a lot, so I decided to put together a little post about how I got through my teenage years. I’ve learned a lot of things in my life so far and I can say that these years aren’t easy. It’s probably going to be one of the most confusing and emotional times in your life. Through all of this though, you are going to learn a lot about who you are as an individual and the joys and hardships that life can bring. I’m just gonna put all my advice and learnings out there. It might be a little rough around the edges, but I hope it can help each and everyone of you in some way or another. I’ll be breaking it down into a couple major points: friendship, romantic relationship, school, social media, personal health, and finances.\n",

      "This is a vital part of your success as a human. We need community, whether you want to admit it or not. I was fortunate to go to the same school from 4th grade to 12th grade and we had a very small class, around 30 people. So we had built in friendships. This didn’t come without its hardships though. Cliques still formed and drama still happened. We also had around 300 people in our high school, 7-12th. One thing I learned from this was that things spread fast, true or not. I can only imagine it’s faster at bigger schools. Drama is like a big game of telephone, you can think you’re telling your friend something in confidence, then they tell their friend and the story gets flipped and twisted. The use of social media also does not help this problem but I will talk more on that later.\n",
      "\n",
      "With all that being said, choose your inner circle very wisely. I was friends with everyone, knew everyone by name from 9-12th grade, around 150 people or so. I had my main group of friends that was around 20 people mixed between boys and girls and I loved them all despite drama, But I only had 6 close friends that I love deeply and would take a bullet for and they would take one for me. These are people that will call me out and I won’t be mad at them and that I can tell everything to, no matter how embarrassing. My inner circle consists of 6 guys. Everyone is different, so don’t think yours has to look like mine, that is not the case. But your circle should help you grow and have your best interests at heart, no matter the circumstance. Regardless of if they are in your inner circle or not, always treat your friends with respect and always…always…always, be there for them. You will truly never know everything about someone. You could know their situation and what they are going through, and they tell you details, but your job as a friend isn’t to ask questions (situational) or try and solve their issues, it’s to be there and to listen. Truly listen to them, try to understand their point of view. I have friends who have self harmed or have tried worse and have opened up about these things to me. I’ve even talked people off the ledge before and it takes a toll. So, keep in mind your own mental health when trying to help someone else, monitor yourself, keep yourself healthy. \n",

I still hang out with mine. They will come to you with a lot of problems that you have already been through. It’s important that you don’t give them the answer, but give your point of view. I know for a fact that mine will be a part of my life for at least the next 10 years.\n",

      "This is something I’m still trying to figure out, but I will still share what I have learned. Don’t date until you can drive! I didn’t follow my own advice here but that’s why I’m sharing it. You can date people in 7th or 8th grade but the odds of that relationship lasting are very, very low. They are low in high school so don’t think I’m dissing on you younger people. Statistically, the odds of you marrying the first person you date are very low, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t date. My first serious relationship was when I was around 10th grade. We dated for around a year and it was a learning experience for me. This first relationship really sets forth what to expect from a romantic partner, likes and dislikes, how to date, and how to handle someone else’s emotions and balance time between life and them. If you can’t even handle your own emotions, I encourage you not to date. Figure yourself out, make yourself someone you would want to date. I was definitely not ready for a relationship and neither was my partner, but that’s part of the learning. I get it, you’re horny and want to do all this stuff with someone you’re so attracted to, but this isn’t what should drive you. We did end up doing sexual things, and that forms a connection even if you break up. There’s something about the first anything you have that will stick with you throughout your life. We broke up and breakups are sad, but take that time to improve yourself, reflect on what you can do better, there is always something that you can do. Take that experience and roll it over to the next partner. \n",
      "\n",
      "Pacing is everything in a relationship. My first was very fast paced and the second girl I “dated” was very slow but great. We talked for about 4 months and hung out all the time. There was one time where I was at her house, and I made a move, and she was not comfortable with it. I apologized profusely, but this eventually ended up being the end of what we had going on. Communication is key, and even if you think it’s going so slow, it might be the first time they have had something like this. Be gentle with them, be very patient. Guys, we are very sexual, learn to suppress that the best you can. Especially if you aren’t officially dating. Let them set the pace of the relationship. \n",
      "\n",
      "A relationship, imo, should look like this. Become their friend and feel things out. If they are interested and you are interested, be more intentional with the time you spend, go on dates, (going on dates doesn’t mean you are dating) just spend time together even if it’s in larger groups. My third relationship looked a lot like this. We talked for at least 5 months and got to know each other very well. We both knew we had interest in each other and we hung out a lot in non romantic contexts, but when we talked about taking our relationship to the next level, friends to dating, she wasn’t ready yet, don’t be sad about that, just keep being friends and being there, but make sure your intentions are still clear, that you want to date. This was the best relationship I’ve had and it only lasted 3 or 4 months. We still talk and keep in touch and hang out from time to time, but we know that it’s just as friends, for now. Like I said, I'm still trying to figure all this out but she’s pretty great and I would date her again in a heartbeat. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, don’t be pushed around. After her, I didn’t date for a year or so. I got into college and met a girl. This relationship was even faster than my first one. Because we moved too fast we grew close fast, but it was kind of an artificial thing, we didn’t really know each other and we broke up after 4 months for multiple reasons. She was very bossy, short tempered, and overall an angry person. It’s hard to see that when you’re in the “honeymoon” phase. Don’t be blinded by the outer beauty to the point where you can’t see the inner beauty. Women are delicate, strong, beautiful, and loving. Don’t break them. \n",

      "School isn’t very fun. Just being honest here, but it truly does go by fast and it is what you make of it. The only reason I went to school was to see my friends and have fun and lighten the mood for everyone else. I was a very good student even though I had diagnosed learning disabilities. Despite that, I had an amazing reputation among peers and teachers. I would be, by today's standards, popular. Homecoming court, NHS, Varsity sports, student council, all of it. The more involved you get, the more fun it is. Trust me. I couldn’t have gotten through school if it weren’t for the people I met through all these things. I encourage you to try new things, step out of your comfort zone. You never know what might come of it. Sports was definitely my thing, especially soccer. Just remember while you’re doing all these things, it’s just high school. Many times in soccer games I would just talk to people, yeah it’s competitive but they are the same age as you and going through similar things as you. Be nice to them too. I played against someone my senior year and I met a kid who was also in his senior year. I didn’t think much of it, but we go to the same college now and he’s a good friend. Just goes to show that you really never know what will come out of trying something new. These are your prime years, make the most of them. Try something new, epically fail at it, and try something new again. I did bowling my last year and I sucked at it… but I had so much fun meeting new people and hanging out with people in my grade that I normally wouldn’t hangout with. \n",

It just wasn’t for me, and there’s nothing wrong with that! Just have a plan if you do decide to go that route. I know exactly how you feel too, “oh man I just did 12 years of school, time for 4 more!” This is true, but college is a different type of learning. It’s stuff you want to learn and you will find yourself with more motivation than in high school. I know I did for the time I was there. Go in with an open mind and get connected. Welcome weeks are a good way to do this, everyone is in the same boat and everyone will want to be your friend pretty much. \n",

You will see an increase in your happiness and productivity once you delete these and if you stick to it, you will be bored. Boredom isn’t a bad thing, it just means you have to pick up something new and try it. I encourage you guys to delete anything that you can watch short form content on for at least 3 days. If you feel like you can’t, that’s even more of a reason to try! I also recommend watching ‘The Social Dilemma’ on Netflix and it’s about the use of social media and how it affects us and how they track everything. It’s a good watch. \n",

Take at least 20-30 minutes out of your day, not at night, to be alone and decompress. Do something that you like to do. I also recommend doing a journal. This may seem cringy, I know I thought it was, but seriously… get your thoughts out on paper, make it whatever you want. Talk about your day or frustrations. In society we are generally meant to keep our emotions in, but be in touch with them. Cry if you need to, you don’t have to put up the front of being strong all the time.

Don’t eat super sugary foods in the morning, eat a bagel or eggs. My go to dish was a bagel with scrambled eggs, cheese, and ham with a bowl of yogurt and fruit.

This is a very personal thing that only your inner circle should know if you’re struggling with and trying to quit. Set up accountability with them. Have them check in with you every now and again about it. There’s no shame in asking for help, most will not be able to do it alone so reach out.

I love mowing grass and detailing cars. That earned me a pretty penny throughout my high school years. You should also be saving a lot of your money.

This isn’t free money, make sure to pay it back IN FULL, not the minimum payment, at the end of every billing cycle. If you can’t responsibly spend your money, don’t risk it. It’s better to not have credit than to get into debt early on. And finally, start saving for retirement. Open a Roth IRA and try to contribute the maximum amount of money every year, if you can’t, try and do at least 100 a month.

      "\n",
      "1) You have thoughts about breaking up. Those do not appear randomly. It's normal to have some in a long term relationship but if 3 months in you are thinking about it, it's a good idea to dig deeper into it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Your relationship is dysfunctional in any way: your partner poison drips you, you're not on the same page in terms of actualization, you feel like it's toxic, resentment has built up over the years, there is a clear lack of communication, the relationship doesn't fit your needs.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3) You live far away from each other. If you are leaving somewhere for more than 2 weeks and you are under 25, and the relationship isn't that serious and heavy, break up. You'll find someone else. There is NO POINT in torturing yourself for nothing, spending hours and hours for something that will not work out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long-distance relationships have always been a huge mystery for me, because as I said once: You might as well be talking to a clever robot on skype and that would be exactly the same. You don't share real-life experiences with the person. Hence, it's pointless. Anyway!\n",
      "\n",
      "Here comes the tricky part, you don't wanna see this. You don't wanna realize your relationship is shitty and go through a breakup. Because :  \n",

      "\" I have regular sex, it's comfortable, I'm used to it, yeah he/she is not the most perfect but I'm not gonna go through the hustle of trying to find someone else, that's too much work, learning pick up or going out with my friends, getting my social skills in check, I'll just stay with him/her and live a comfortable life, etc\"  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you've been in a relationship for a while, you're used to the comfort and you will sometimes even agree to undergo abuse just to stay in homeostasis and in comfort because you hate change. And only when you look back, you realize how toxic your past relationships were.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4) If overall the whole situation is messed up, someone cheated on someone else, etc, so on and so forth. I'm not gonna list this for ages, simply: **be honest with yourself and don't try to hold on and stay comfortable.**\n",

If they go full drama on you and wanna fix stuff, and you feel like you can't handle it, simply RUN AWAY and never talk to them again. This may sound horrible, but once their ego is hurt, they are not on your side. When someone feels hurt, they will try to damage you as much as humanly possible so you stay and regret your decision. Do not get caught up in that toxic crap and RUN AWAY if needed. Cut all ties with the person, burn all the boats, explode all the bridges. Forever and as fast as you can. There is no coming back. Block them from anywhere, cut ties with any friends you have in common, blacklist their number and cut all contact forever.  \n",

      "\n",
      "A year or two ago, I was in the same boat as a lot of you. I hadn’t finished highschool yet, my self esteem was in the gutter, I couldn’t really talk to many people and I didn’t see any positive change in sight. If you don’t believe me, my own self – loathing is just a few months away in my post history on this very subreddit. Learn from my past edgy self. Don’t be me.\n",

      "\n",
      "So, you want to think more positively but everything is a shitshow? You’re reading the right section.\n",
      "Positivity is a hard concept to grasp and the advice “just be positive” sucks hard. Lets begin the way we should begin all things, by taking a small step toward our end goal. If your goal is to have a more positive outlook on life, **you first have to start actively looking for positive moments before your brain can subconsciously identify them.**\n",
      "\n",
      "The best approach to this, in my opinion, is by keeping a gratitude or positivity log. I personally use my Bullet Journal to do this, but feel free to use any note taking app or notebook you’d like. You can format this however you want, but the key point when logging in a gratitude log is to write down **one positive experience per day**, just one. One thing you’re grateful for that you are genuinely happy was in your life. Maybe your mom gave you a ride to school, you were able to afford lunch out, you have a good friend or teacher who made you smile. Looking at things like this, and actively attempting to find the positive at first slowly becomes a passive skill, where you no longer need to try so hard to find it. Make it a goal to log this quickly once a day. *Try not to miss any days, but remember if you do, just pick up and try again tomorrow.*\n",
      "\n",
      "The alternative is a positivity log, which I think is a more thought provoking method of active positivity. A positivity log should briefly summarize the following. \n",
      "1)\tWhat you were grateful for that day\n",
      "2)\tWhat you are proud of yourself for accomplishing (big or small)\n",

If you’re going through a bad time, give yourself the same advice and affirmations you’d give someone else, if they were telling you about their problems **This is not selfish.** When I first started, I thought giving myself credit for accomplishing tasks was arrogant. Its not. Arrogance is when you believe you know better or are better than everyone.

      "\n",
      "The best place to start would be August, 2014. I had been grounded for a month recently for going to a party, and I had no car, nor ability to do anything besides bike to work for most of my summer vacation. When I finally got my freedom back, I celebrated by occasionally getting high with my friends. At this point in my life, I was raking in about 700$ a month from working with no expenses, so I had plenty of discretionary income. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then, one night, I came home from work at about 11:30 (we finish at 11 and it was a 30 min bike ride), so I decided to load a bowl in this secondhand bubbler I had. Long story short, I ended up receiving a minor in possession that evening while being lectured by two cops for two hours while I was trying to eat my burrito (I work at a popular mexican place named after a pepper, and I wanted to enjoy my munchies at least). My parents had called the cops on me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was not one to concern myself about the future, so I revised my tactics, made sure I wouldn't get caught again, and set aside some money for my october court date, thinking I could pay the fine immediately, do some community service, and deal with the few months of probation that would be assigned to me or whatever. \n",
      "\n",
      "For court, I was set on this program called Diversion, where they basically make you go through structured therapy to fix some shit in your life because apparently I was an at risk youth, despite earning above average grades and despite working 28 hours a week. In Diversion, I learned a critical lesson. There are people who take the law very seriously and will struggle to uphold it no matter what their personal beliefs are. I believe this is wrong, but these people exist and they run our lives. \n",
      "\n",
      "Due to my argumentative nature, my diversion officer decided that she would not touch the marijuana subject with a ten foot pole. We decided to focus on the family conflict that had been raging with my parents since the august incident. During this time, I also bought a car, in my name, with my insurance. And I was damn proud of my 2000 audi a4, because it became my space and my home, in more ways, which I will get into. Im a huge car guy. \n",
      "\n",
      "After providing progressively lower to the point of clean marijuana tests, I was placed on a once a month drug test instead of once a week (those cost $20 a pop and $80 a month is crucial). I learned how to easily pass drug tests, invaluable knowledge, but despite me complying with the program, my prospects did not look up.\n",
      "\n",
      "We tried family counseling with the program and it was not effective. This all came to a climax when in early december, my parents decided to enter my vehicle by taking my key while I was sleeping and it was parked off of their property. If I was 18, I would have pressed charges because of how much our relationship had deteriorated. I got home from work and realized this, so I confronted them at 11:00 at night, and they kicked me out of their house. I got my shit together and left. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am a bit of a planner, so I always had a contingency plan if shit hi the fan. I had a setup where I could do laundry at the laundromat, use my gym membership (paid for by me) to shower, and I could get a lot of food for cheap because of my job. My parents had already revoked me going to college with their help, so I was planning on living with two other people come March, my birthday, anyway. I ended up living out of my car for five nights, and that was the happiest I had been in awhile. I handled my responsibilities, attended school, went to work, and the world kept turning. My parents said they wanted to meet at a mutual place, and my diversion officer thought this was a good idea. I told them both to fuck off, and that I was busy getting on with my life. I also told my diversion officer that I planned to continue seeing her, but that we would have to find a new issue to address for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "So here I was, busy being an at risk youth, despite actually somewhat having my shit together. Then, at 7 A. M. on a tuesday morning, my slumber was rudely interrupted by two policemen. My car was parked in a very out of the way location, and my window tint would not show that anyone was in there unless they were inches from the glass, so I knew something was up. I groggily stumbled out of my sleeping bag, greeted the officers with a good morning, and asked what I could help them with. They immediately searched my vehicle, found some weed, and hauled me to this center. \n",
      "\n",
      "This part of the story bothers me more than anything else. My parents had reported me as a run away. I explained that I had been kicked out, and that I had not let voluntarily. Absolutely no one in the justice system cared. When my parents came to pick me up, they acted like it was a big happy reunion. It took all of my dignity not to earn me two shiny assault charges as well as my current ones. \n",

      "After seeing Zoo lights with my girlfriend on acid, I decided to make amends with my parents. I decided that the hate, the shit flinging, and the  general anger should stop. So I did what I could to end it, and for their credit, they did too. We worked together, and came across as more of a family in group therapy. Mid december I stopped smoking for a long time because I was too suspicious to trust them not to invade my space. \n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, my diversion officer was not as happy. She decided we needed a new issue to address, because clean UA's and our family getting along weren't enough. This, combined with a switch in the places that I did UA's at, which had no testing schedule, gave her the excuse to kick me off the diversion program. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the next week I was floored. I had suicidal thoughts daily. I made the mistake of expressing these to the diversion officer, and I found myself in what essentially amounts to a therapeutic jail 24 hours later. I was stripped of everything, including my fucking hoody strings, which are nearly impossible to put back in. I made the resolution to not kill myself for the sake of my girlfriend. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I got out of diversion, I was free from drug tests, counseling bullshit  (not knocking it for others, but all it does is piss me off), and I had no one trying to control me for awhile. I also had to deal with a speeding ticket, but thats not a big deal. I enjoyed smoking on my lunch breaks with my friends, or after work with my coworkers, but I was careful, and was not caught during this time. Unfortunately, my girlfriend and I broke up because we could only see each other once a week, if that. She also pretty much blew off the romantic valetines day I had planned for us, to make up for missing actual valentines day, because she was somewhere doing volleyball stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was legitimately happy during this time. I reconnected with my friends, my parents and I got along better, it was great. I bought another car because my audi shit the bed with problems, so now I have a 1991 mazda Miata. \n",
      "\n",
      "Court came around, however. I was placed on a pre-trial program, which means random UA's (both passed so far), and downright draconian conditions, which basically only permitted me to go to school and work for a week (I missed a Dada Life concert because of this), and now that I am on the second step of that, I am allowed free time until 6 o clock in the evening. I am an adult for fucks sake, I do not like being treated like a kid. I am also not legally allowed to even move away from my parents, despite my savings and intentions to do so. My relationship has become steadily more toxic with them, and each day I am slipping further intro depression. There are three district attorneys currently discussing what they intend to do to me. None of them will show any sympathy. \n",

      "For my crimes against the citizens of the United States of America, I am potentially facing in the thousands of dollars in fines, potential jail time due to my age now, probation for long periods of time, a large amount of community service, or whatever else they can cook up for me, and I can guarantee they will not go easy on me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Is this truly justice? The only thing I am a threat to when I am high is my wallet because I spent too much money at Village Inn. But I have realized that \"Justice\" is a business, with people doing their jobs, just like I do five days a week. Just like making a burrito, they choose the contents of the punishment and serve it to the customer, even if they disagree what is in the burrito, but they sell it to them anyway, simply because they do not give a fuck whether its a shitty burrito or not. I do not give a single fuck about serving a burrito that has weird or disturbing ingredient combinations, rather I just make sure the product comes out as best it can and as efficiently as possible. These people have the exact same mentality. Some of them might even enjoy marijuana, just like I might enjoy a shitty burrito, because at the end of the day, they don't give a fuck about it just like me for each individual burrito. But the difference is, my burritos don't ruin peoples lives, or futures, they just might ruin someones underpants. My life, for the forseeable future, is fucked, because Marijuana ruins lives, not the justice system.\n",

      "Title: Zoop\n",
      "Content: Let's start, and end, with the shirts. Dressing is a big deal to me -- ever since I (a) became single, and (b) lost 60 pounds, I've become something of a clotheshorse. I don't know the etymology of that expression, but it's such a neat word I wanted to use it. (Am I like a sawhorse, but for clothing instead of sawing?)\n",
      "\n",
      "At any rate, I've started shopping at the smallest, snottiest, exclusiviest (I know, not a word) little men's boutiques I can find. At first I was content merely having the guys at Nordstrom all know me by name (and call me when they got a new season's worth of fashions), but that was merely a gateway (like marijuana in the eyes of conservatives) to littler shops, where each individual thread in a garment has a value measured in dollars, not pennies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sadly, these kinds of shirts require dry-cleaning, which requires that I make it to the dry-cleaner. This is something of an issue for me, because I'm wont to keep odd hours, and because when I'm awake I'm usually working (c.f. \"being single, the suckiness inherent therein\"). So, for the last week, in preparation for WWDC, I've been driving around with a big blue laundry bag full of dirty shirts in the passenger seat of my pimp ride.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should mention that, when I was a wee lad, I had visions of one day getting a pimp ride, so that when I passed pretty women on the side of the street who were forlornly walking somewhere, I could pull up and say, \"Hey, mamasita, you want a ride?\" I've since been informed that women find this, in fact, really creepy, so I've never actually done it, but I have to mention that every guy has a fantasy of one day doing this, even while admitting this fantasy is in direct opposition to any possible reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "[I should also mention that should I wish to Jackson out and hit on 12-year-old boys, instead of women, a pimp ride is the perfect way to go. The number of times I've had 12-year-old boys yell out \"pimp-de-pimp-pimp-pimp!\" to me when I drive by is surprisingly high, considering I had previously never heard the \"pimp-de-pimp-pimp-pimp\" call and have no idea what it means. But for 12-year-olds it's some kind of lingua franca.]\n",
      "\n",
      "At any rate, you can imagine how cool it is to drive by a pretty woman walking in the rain and think, \"Hey, I should offer her a ride... wait, then she'd have to have my big bag of stinky shirts in her lap... that'd probably strike her as pretty strange... possibly even frightening.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "--\n",
      "\n",
      "So it is that, when packing for WWDC 2005, I only took one good shirt with me. Mind you, this was a reallygood shirt. This shirt was made in London by a guy named Ted or James or some such, which to me lends instant credibility to it, because as much as I love (the blue states in) my country, when I think of America I think of rebels, I think of individualists, I think of can-do spirit and an indomitable dedication to individual freedoms and happiness. But I don't think, \"nice shirts!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "London, on the other hand, has class and panache, and Ted/James clearly was the latest in a long line of shirt-makers who had, for generations, been making shirts for discerning gentlemen, not carrying guns, and/or shipping off criminals to unsettled countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor is the cotton in this shirt simply from normal cotton plants, oh no. It's grown someplace exotic, like Morocco, and it seems to carry a slight scent of the spices of distant lands on it. Bury your face in this shirt and you can almost hear Bogey whispering, \"Listen, kid, this shirt is bigger than the both of us...\" \n",
      "\n",
      "I've received about five or so unsolicited compliments in this shirt, which is five more than I have in any other shirt. Guys don't get complimented on shirts a lot, unless they say, \"Hey, look at this shirt,\" which I admit I've done a couple times, but I'm saying I've been complimented on this shirt without fishing for it, five times.\n",
      "\n",
      "--\n",
      "\n",
      "And so I wore this shirt on Tuesday at WWDC 2005, because Tuesday was the day of the Apple Design Awards. My previous company had won a number of these when I was running it, and so this award had a personal meaning to me. This was the first time my new company had entered, and I had high hopes. And, should I win, I wanted to be up on that stage smiling at the crowd while looking fine in my shirt that combined the best parts of London and Morocco.\n",
      "\n",
      "And here's where the story take a tragic turn, because, in their unknowable yet infallible wisdom, Apple suddenly decided the Design Awards would be on Wednesday. I found this out late Tuesday, and spent the day grousing to all and sundry about how this messed up my plans vis-a-vis the shirt. And everyone agreed that it was, in fact, a very nice shirt, but I should note that I didn't count these compliments towards my previously-mentioned total of five, because I was really fishing.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment I thought this mishap might end up for the best, because that night several of us nerds ended up at a bar, and in my mildly drunken state I started talking with a pretty lady about... well, I don't remember. Something, I'm sure. We'll call her Laurie Anderson, because she looks just like a young Laurie Anderson, and it'll be more evocative this way. I didn't exactly hit on Laurie, per se, but I will say I was glad I was wearing a nice shirt. It wasn't until the next night that one of her friends let me know, in a very friendly manner, that if I had intentions towards Ms. Anderson I might reconsider them, because she was, in fact, as interested in women as I was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which was a nice thing to do, frankly, because it's good to know the boundaries of your relationship with someone right at the start -- I like it when women I'm talking to let it be known they have a steady boyfriend, for example, not because I can then cut bait and run, but because I can adjust my expectations and demeanor accordingly, and not embarrass myself or her. For example, you don't say, \"I want to nibble your neck,\" to a woman with a boyfriend. Instead, you'd use the more coy, \"If you didn't have a boyfriend, I would certainly be interested in your neck, vis-a-vis the nibbling thereof.\" See, it's all about delivery.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, upon reflection later that night, I felt I hadn't made very effective use of my shirt, and so it was with a heavy heart that I finally took it off, realizing that it had been sullied for naught. Actually, I was pretty drunk when I got back to the hotel, so all I remember is thinking how much effort it was to take clothes off and put them in a pile.\n",
      "\n",
      "--\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the next afternoon (morning having been lost to C2H5OH), while I was putting on one of my t-shirts and again mentioning how unhappy I was to be thus dressed for the Design Awards, that Mike said, with that clarity of vision associated with the genius, \"Hey, you could, like, go buy a new shirt.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "T2 and I looked at each other, and although it may have been that we were both still under the affects of chemicals, we instantly agreed this was why Mike was The Smart One. My day had a purpose now, and my step had a spring to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked the concierge where I might find a fancy, fashion-forward shirt in downtown San Francisco. I figured this would be a slam-dunk. Here's a city whose culture ranks up there with New York and Paris. Here's a city where the rich scions of industry have nothing to do with their money but impress each other with their fancy baubles and ornaments.\n",
      "\n",
      "She pulled out a map and circled a block. \"Here's a Nordstrom's!\" Wrong, wrong, wrong. First off, Nordstrom's is NOT fashion-forward, even if they do try to sell orange shirts to golfers in the winter. Second, if I wanted to go to freaking Nordstrom's, I'd GO TO THE ORIGINAL ONE, RIGHT NEXT TO WHERE I LIVE. I'm in San Francisco. The city by the bay! Wow me with your culture!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's a Saks on 3rd?\" NO! No no no no no! You are not getting me. I want a boutique. \"Well, Nordstrom's has different departments, they're kind of like boutiques...\" No! How'd we get back here? Seriously, no!\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, suddenly, she saw. \"Oh, there's a little place called Pink, you might check that out, if you're not freaked out by the name.\" Lady, I'm a true metrosexual. I'm not worried about my masculinity when I shop. You could tell me the store is called \"Sweaty Men in a Bathhouse\" and I'd go there if it had Moroccan cotton.\n",
      "\n",
      "T2 and I jumped into a cab and I immediately bought two \"slim-fit\" shirts from Thomas Pink, of London. The gentlemen who helped us were classy and helpful without the slightest trace of condescension, which was nice considering I came in wearing a WWDC polo shirt and T2 had what appeared to be an original 1970s \"Dark Side of the Moon\" T-shirt on.\n",
      "\n",
      "--\n",
      "\n",
      "This year was the 10th anniversary of the Apple Design awards, and as such they decided to celebrate by gussing the whole event up, in an homage/parody of the Academy Awards. This struck me as entirely apropos, as I estimate to the 1,000 of us nerds who were there, this was our Academy Awards. This was our Nobel prize. This was our moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the start of the evening one of the high mucky-mucks of Developer Relations, who happens to be a very pretty lady, floated onstage in a drop-dead gorgeous gown. We'll call her Natasha Richardsonbecause she looks like a Natasha's younger sister might. (Yes, I know Natasha already has a younger sister.)\n",
      "\n",
      "There's another fact you should know at this point, which is that nerds are not, inherently, asexual. We don't have much success with women, but that doesn't mean we are immune to their charms. Quite the opposite. We fall under such a spell that we are unable to function, and this renders us so unattractive that it creates a self-perpetuating cycle of desperate singlehood.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, in that first moment, 1,000 nerds fell in love with Natasha. Well, 996 nerd guys fell in love with her, and the four women in the crowd thought, \"Wow, I wonder where she got that dress?\" (Laurie Anderson was out partying elsewhere, but I think it's safe to assume she would have been crushing, too, had she been present.)\n",
      "\n",
      "As she started to speak a strange calm came over the crowd, as if we were cavemen seeing fire for the first time, or rats hearing a certain piper. There was also some guy in a tux on stage with her, I think. I don't know if anyone remembers. Maybe he was tall?\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately my mind was no longer on whether I won the award, but on what I would say to her if I did. When the first award was given, the guy who won it kept whispering things to her as his product was described to the crowd, and I noticed that her lapel mic was sensitive enough that we could all hear what he was saying. This dashed somewhat my plans to hit on her on-stage, because everyone in the crowd would be able to hear me saying, \"So, uh, want to ride in my car sometime, uh, assuming I move the laundry? I've been led to understand that it's, uh, pimp-de-pimp-pimp-pimp.\"\n",

Barry follows shortly after Vanessa’s cab. He catches up to it, and he pounds on the window. INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS Barry motions for her to roll the window down. She does so. BARRY Roses?! VANESSA Barry? BARRY (as he flies next to the cab) Roses are flowers. VANESSA Yes, they are. BARRY Flowers, bees, pollen! VANESSA I know. That’s why this is the last parade. BARRY Maybe not. The cab starts pulling ahead of Barry. BARRY (CONT'D) (re: driver) Could you ask him to slow down? VANESSA Could you slow down? The cabs slows. Barry flies in the window, and lands in the change box, which closes on him. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 105. VANESSA (CONT'D) Barry! Vanessa lets him out. Barry stands on the change box, in front of the driver’s license. BARRY Okay, I made a huge mistake! This is a total disaster, and it’s all my fault! VANESSA Yes, it kind of is. BARRY I’ve ruined the planet. And, I wanted to help with your flower shop. Instead, I’ve made it worse. VANESSA Actually, it’s completely closed down. BARRY Oh, I thought maybe you were remodeling. Nonetheless, I have another idea. And it’s greater than all my previous great ideas combined. VANESSA I don’t want to hear it. Vanessa closes the change box on Barry. BARRY (opening it again) Alright, here’s what I’m thinking. They have the roses, the roses have the pollen. I know every bee, plant, and flower bud in this park. All we’ve got to do is get what they’ve got back here with what we’ve got. VANESSA Bees... BARRY Park... VANESSA Pollen... \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 106. BARRY Flowers... VANESSA Repollination! BARRY (on luggage handle, going up) Across the nation! CUT TO: SEQ. 3950 - “ROSE PARADE” EXT. PASADENA PARADE BARRY (V.O) Alright. Tournament of Roses. Pasadena, California. They’ve got nothing but flowers, floats, and cotton candy. Security will be tight. VANESSA I have an idea. CUT TO: EXT. FLOAT STAGING AREA ANGLE ON: Barry and Vanessa approaching a HEAVILY ARMED GUARD in front of the staging area. VANESSA Vanessa Bloome, FTD. Official floral business. He leans in to look at her badge. She SNAPS IT SHUT, VANESSA (CONT’D) Oh, it’s real. HEAVILY ARMED GUARD Sorry ma’am. That’s a nice brooch, by the way. VANESSA Thank you. It was a gift. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 107. They ENTER the staging area. BARRY (V.O) Then, once we’re inside, we just pick the right float. VANESSA How about the Princess and the Pea? BARRY Yeah.

FLOAT STAGING AREA - A FEW MOMENTS LATER Barry, dressed as a PEA, flies up and hovers in front of the princess on the “Princess and the Pea” float. The float is sponsored by Inflat-a-bed and a SIGN READS: “Inflat-a-bed: If it blows, it’s ours.” BARRY Sorry I’m late. Where should I sit? PRINCESS What are you? BARRY I believe I’m the pea. PRINCESS The pea? It’s supposed to be under the mattresses. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 108. BARRY Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. PRINCESS I’m going to go talk to the marshall. BARRY You do that. This whole parade is a fiasco! She EXITS. Vanessa removes the step-ladder. The princess FALLS. Barry and Vanessa take off in the float. BARRY (CONT’D) Let’s see what this baby will do. ANGLE ON: Guy with headset talking to drivers. HEADSET GUY Hey! The float ZOOMS by. A young CHILD in the stands, TIMMY, cries. CUT TO: EXT. FLOAT STAGING AREA - A FEW MOMENTS LATER ANGLE ON: Vanessa putting the princess hat on. BARRY (V.O) Then all we do is blend in with traffic, without arousing suspicion. CUT TO: EXT. THE PARADE ROUTE - CONTINUOUS The floats go flying by the crowds. Barry and Vanessa’s float CRASHES through the fence. CUT TO: \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 109. EXT. LA FREEWAY Vanessa and Barry speed, dodging and weaving, down the freeway. BARRY (V.O) And once we’re at the airport, there’s no stopping us. CUT TO: EXT. LAX AIRPORT Barry and Vanessa pull up to the curb, in front of an TSA AGENT WITH CLIPBOARD. TSA AGENT Stop. Security. Did you and your insect pack your own float? VANESSA (O.C) Yes. TSA AGENT Has this float been in your possession the entire time? VANESSA (O.C) Since the parade...yes. ANGLE ON: Barry holding his shoes. TSA AGENT Would you remove your shoes and everything in your pockets? Can you remove your stinger, Sir? BARRY That’s part of me. TSA AGENT I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight. CUT TO: EXT. RUNWAY Barry and Vanessa’s airplane TAKES OFF. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 110. BARRY (O.C) Then, if we’re lucky, we’ll have just enough pollen to do the job. DISSOLVE TO: SEQ. 4025 - “COCKPIT FIGHT” INT. AIRPLANE Vanessa is on the aisle. Barry is on a laptop calculating flowers, pollen, number of bees, airspeed, etc. He does a “Stomp” dance on the keyboard. BARRY Can you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job. I think this is going to work, Vanessa. VANESSA It’s got to work. PILOT (V.O) Attention passengers. This is Captain Scott. I’m afraid we have a bit of bad weather in the New York area. And looks like we’re going to be experiencing a couple of hours delay. VANESSA Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They’ll never make it. BARRY I’ve got to get up there and talk to these guys. VANESSA Be careful. Barry flies up to the cockpit door. CUT TO: INT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS A female flight attendant, ANGELA, is in the cockpit with the pilots. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 111. There’s a KNOCK at the door. BARRY (C.O) Hey, can I get some help with this Sky Mall Magazine? I’d like to order the talking inflatable travel pool filter. ANGELA (to the pilots, irritated) Excuse me. CUT TO: EXT. CABIN - CONTINUOUS Angela opens the cockpit door and looks around. She doesn’t see anybody. ANGLE ON: Barry hidden on the yellow and black “caution” stripe. As Angela looks around, Barry zips into the cockpit. CUT TO: INT. COCKPIT BARRY Excuse me, Captain. I am in a real situation here... PILOT (pulling an earphone back, to the co-pilot) What did you say, Hal? CO-PILOT I didn’t say anything. PILOT (he sees Barry) Ahhh! Bee! BARRY No, no! Don’t freak out! There’s a chance my entire species-- CO-PILOT (taking off his earphones) Ahhh! \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 112. The pilot grabs a “DUSTBUSTER” vacuum cleaner. He aims it around trying to vacuum up Barry. The co-pilot faces camera, as the pilot tries to suck Barry up. Barry is on the other side of the co-pilot. As they dosey-do, the toupee of the co-pilot begins to come up, still attached to the front. CO-PILOT (CONT'D) What are you doing? Stop! The toupee comes off the co-pilot’s head, and sticks in the Dustbuster. Barry runs across the bald head. BARRY Wait a minute! I’m an attorney! CO-PILOT Who’s an attorney? PILOT Don’t move. The pilot uses the Dustbuster to try and mash Barry, who is hovering in front of the co-pilot’s nose, and knocks out the co-pilot who falls out of his chair, hitting the life raft release button. The life raft inflates, hitting the pilot, knocking him into a wall and out cold. Barry surveys the situation. BARRY Oh, Barry. CUT TO: INT. AIRPLANE CABIN Vanessa studies her laptop, looking serious. SFX: PA CRACKLE. BARRY (V.O) (in captain voice) Good afternoon passengers, this is your captain speaking. Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24F please report to the cockpit. And please hurry! \"Bee Movie\"  - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 113. ANGLE ON: The aisle, and Vanessa head popping up. CUT TO: INT. COCKPIT Vanessa ENTERS. VANESSA What happened here? BARRY I tried to talk to them, but then there was a Dustbuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded...Now one’s bald, one’s in a boat, and they’re both unconscious. VANESSA Is that another bee joke? BARRY No. No one’s flying the plane. The AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER, BUD, speaks over the radio. BUD This is JFK control tower. Flight 356, what’s your status? Vanessa presses a button, and the intercom comes on. VANESSA This is Vanessa Bloome. I’m a florist from New York. BUD Where’s the pilot? VANESSA He’s unconscious and so is the copilot. BUD Not good. Is there anyone onboard who has flight experience? A BEAT. BARRY As a matter of fact, there is. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 114. BUD Who’s that? VANESSA Barry Benson. BUD From the honey trial? Oh great. BARRY Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee. It’s got giant wings, huge engines. VANESSA I can’t fly a plane. BARRY Why not? Isn’t John Travolta a pilot? VANESSA Yes? BARRY How hard could it be? VANESSA Wait a minute. Barry, we’re headed into some lightning. CUT TO: Vanessa shrugs, and takes the controls. SEQ. 4150 - “BARRY FLIES PLANE” INT. BENSON HOUSE The family is all huddled around the TV at the Benson house. ANGLE ON: TV. Bob Bumble is broadcasting. BOB BUMBLE This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK airport, where a very suspenseful scene is developing. Barry Benson, fresh off his stunning legal victory... \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 115. Adam SPRAYS a can of HONEY-WHIP into his mouth. ADAM That’s Barry. BOB BUMBLE ...is now attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers, and an incapacitated flight crew. EVERYONE Flowers?! CUT TO: INT. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER BUD Well, we have an electrical storm in the area, and two individuals at the controls of a jumbo jet with absolutely no flight experience. JEANETTE CHUNG Just a minute, Mr. Ditchwater, there’s a honey bee on that plane. BUD Oh, I’m quite familiar with Mr. Benson’s work, and his no-account compadres. Haven’t they done enough damage already? JEANETTE CHUNG But isn’t he your only hope right now? BUD Come on, technically a bee shouldn’t be able to fly at all. CUT TO: INT. COCKPIT. Barry REACTS BUD The wings are too small, their bodies are too big-- \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 116. BARRY (over PA) Hey, hold on a second. Haven’t we heard this million times? The surface area of the wings, and the body mass doesn’t make sense? JEANETTE CHUNG Get this on the air. CAMERAMAN You got it! CUT TO: INT. BEE TV CONTROL ROOM An engineer throws a switch. BEE ENGINEER Stand by. We’re going live. The “ON AIR” sign illuminates. CUT TO: INT. VARIOUS SHOTS OF NEW HIVE CITY The news report plays on TV. The pollen jocks are sitting around, playing paddle-ball, Wheel-o, and one of them is spinning his helmet on his finger. Buzzwell is in an office cubicle, playing computer solitaire. Barry’s family and Adam watch from their living room. Bees sitting on the street curb turn around to watch the TV. BARRY Mr. Ditchwater, the way we work may be a mystery to you, because making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs. But let me tell you something about a small job. If you do it really well, it makes a big difference. More than we realized. To us, to everyone. That’s why I want to get bees back to doing what we do best. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 117. Working together. That’s the bee way. We’re not made of Jello. We get behind a fellow. Black and yellow. CROWD OF BEES Hello! CUT TO: INT. COCKPIT Barry is giving orders to Vanessa.

A BOLT OF LIGHTNING HITS the plane. The plane takes a sharp dip.  VANESSA (CONT’D) Barry, what happened? BARRY (noticing the control panel) Wait a minute. I think we were on autopilot that whole time. VANESSA That may have been helping me. BARRY And now we’re not! VANESSA (V.O.)

The bees follow Lou Loduca, and EXIT J-Gate. CUT TO: INT. AIRPLANE COCKPIT BARRY Our only chance is if I do what I would do, and you copy me with the wings of the plane! VANESSA You don’t have to yell. BARRY I’m not yelling. We happen to be in a lot of trouble here. VANESSA It’s very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice. BARRY It’s not a tone. I’m panicking! CUT TO: \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 119. EXT. JFK AIRPORT ANGLE ON: The bees arriving and massing at the airport. CUT TO: INT.

LOU LODUCA Hey Benson, have you got any flowers for a happy occasion in there? CUT TO: INT. COCKPIT Lou, Buzz, Splitz, and Jackson come up alongside the cockpit. BARRY The pollen jocks! VANESSA They do get behind a fellow. BARRY Black and yellow. LOU LODUCA (over headset) Hello. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 121.

A GIANT SHAPE OF A FLOWER is forming in the middle of the runway. BARRY Wait a minute. I think I’m feeling something. VANESSA What? BARRY I don’t know, but it’s strong. And it’s pulling me, like a 27 million year old instinct. Bring the nose of the plane down. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 122. LOU LODUCA (CONT'D) EXT.

The plane attempts to land on top of an “Aloha Airlines” plane with flowers painted on it. BARRY (V.O) I mean the giant black and yellow pulsating flower made of millions of bees! VANESSA Which flower? BARRY That flower! VANESSA I’m aiming at the flower! The plane goes after a FAT GUY IN A HAWAIIAN SHIRT. BARRY (V.O) That’s a fat guy in a flowered shirt! The other other flower! The big one. He snaps a photo and runs away. BARRY (CONT'D) Full forward. Ready boys? Nose down. Bring your tail up. Rotate around it. VANESSA Oh, this is insane, Barry. BARRY This is the only way I know how to fly. CUT TO: \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 124. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER BUD Am I koo-koo kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern? CUT TO: EXT. RUNWAY BARRY (V.O) Get your nose in there. Don’t be afraid of it. Smell it. Full reverse! Easy, just drop it. Be a part of it. Aim for the center! Now drop it in. Drop it in, woman!

No high five. VANESSA Right. ADAM Barry, it worked. Did you see the giant flower? BARRY What giant flower? Where? Of course I saw the flower! That was genius, man. Genius! ADAM Thank you. BARRY But we’re not done yet. Barry flies up to the wing of the plane, and addresses the bee crowd. BARRY (CONT’D) Listen everyone. This runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth. That means this is our last chance. We’re the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers, and dress like this. If we’re going to survive as a species, this is our moment. So what do you all say? Are we going to be bees, or just Museum of Natural History key chains? BEES We’re bees! KEYCHAIN BEE Keychain! BARRY Then follow me... Except Keychain. BUZZ Hold on Barry. You’ve earned this. Buzz puts a pollen jock jacket and helmet with Barry’s name on it on Barry. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 126. BARRY I’m a pollen jock! (looking at the jacket.

      "**Cheating in video games** involves a [video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game) player using various methods to create an advantage beyond normal [gameplay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay), in order to make the game easier. Cheats may be activated from within the game itself (a cheat code implemented by the original game developers), or created by third-party software (a game trainer or debugger) or hardware (a [cheat cartridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheat_cartridge)). They can also be realized by exploiting [software bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug); this may or may not be considered cheating based on whether the bug is considered common knowledge. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cheating in video games has existed for almost their entire [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_games). The first cheat codes were put in place for [play testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playtest) purposes. Playtesters had to rigorously test the mechanics of a game and introduced cheat codes to make this process easier. An early cheat code can be found in [*Manic Miner*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_Miner), where typing \"6031769\" (based on [Matthew Smith's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Smith_(games_programmer)) driving license) enables the cheat mode.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_video_games#cite_note-1) Within months of [*Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizardry:_Proving_Grounds_of_the_Mad_Overlord)'s 1981 release, at least two commercial trainers appeared.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_video_games#cite_note-maher20120326-2) 1983 advertisements for \"The Great Escape Utility\" for [*Castle Wolfenstein*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Wolfenstein) (1981) promised that the $15 product \"remodels every feature of the game. Stop startup delays, crashes and chest waiting. Get any item, in any quantity. Start in any room, at any rank. Handicap your aim. Even add items\".[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_video_games#cite_note-cgw198402-3)\n",
      "\n",
      "In a computer game, all numerical values are stored \"as is\" in memory. Gamers could reprogram a small part of the game before launching it. In the context of games for many 8-bit computers, it was a usual practice to load games into memory and, before launching them, modify specific memory addresses in order to cheat, getting an unlimited number of lives, currency, immunity, invisibility, etc. Such modifications were performed through [POKE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEEK_and_POKE) statements. The [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64), Amstrad CPC range and ZX Spectrum also allowed players with the proper cartridges or [Multiface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiface) add-on to freeze the running program, enter POKEs, and resume. Some games tried to detect the Multiface and refused to load if it was present. The earliest models had no ability to \"hide\". Later revisions either included a switch, hid if the menu had been opened and closed before loading the game, or automatically hid.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, with POKE 47196,201  \n",
      " in [*Knight Lore*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Lore) for the ZX Spectrum, immunity is achieved. Magazines such as [*Crash*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_(magazine)) regularly featured lists of such [POKE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEEK_and_POKE) instructions for games. In order to find them a [hacker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security)) had to interpret the [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code) and locate the critical point where the number of lives is decreased, impacts detected, etc. Sometimes the term POKE was used with this specific meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cheating was exploited by technology-oriented players due to the difficulty of early cheats. However, a cheat industry emerged as gaming systems evolved, through the packaging and selling of cheating as a product.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_video_games#cite_note-4) Cheat-enablers such as cheat books, game guides, cheat cartridges helped form a cheat industry and cemented cheating as part of gaming culture.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_video_games#cite_note-5) However, cheating was not universally accepted in early gaming; gaming magazine [*Amiga Power*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_Power) condemned cheaters, taking the stance that cheating was not part of their philosophy of fairness. They also applied this in reverse; games should also not be allowed to cheat the player. Guides, walkthroughs, and tutorials are sometimes used to complete games but whether this is cheating is debated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, cheating grew more popular with magazines, websites, and even a television show, [*Cheat!*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheat!), dedicated to listing cheats and walkthroughs for consoles and computer systems. POKE cheats were replaced by trainers[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_video_games#cite_note-6) and cheat codes. Generally, the majority of cheat codes on modern day systems are implemented not by gamers, but by [game developers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_developer). Some say that as many people do not have the time to complete a video game on their own, cheats are needed to make a game more accessible and appealing to a casual gamer.[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_video_games#cite_note-7) In many cases, developers created cheats to facilitate testing, then left them in the game as they expanded the number of ways people could play it.[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_video_games#cite_note-8) With the rise in popularity of gaming, cheating using external software and hardware raised a number of copyright legal issues related to modifying game code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many modern games have removed cheat codes entirely, except when used to unlock certain secret bonuses. The usage of real-time achievement tracking made it unfair for any one player to cheat. In online multiplayer games, cheating is frowned upon and disallowed, often leading to a [ban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%26b). However, certain games may unlock single-player cheats if the player fulfills a certain condition. Yet other games, such as those using the [Source engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(game_engine)), allow developer consoles to be used to activate a wide variety of cheats in single-player or by server administrators.\\[[*citation needed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "Many games which use in-game purchases consider cheating to be not only wrong but also illegal, seeing as cheats in such games would allow players to access content (like power-ups and extra coins) that would otherwise require payment to obtain. However, cheating in such games is nonetheless a legal grey area because there are no laws against modifying software which is already owned, as detailed in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_video_games#cite_note-9)\n",

      "The most basic type of cheat code is one created by the game designers and hidden within the [video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game) itself, that will cause any type of uncommon effect that is not part of the usual game mechanics.[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_video_games#cite_note-sezen-10)\n",
      "\n",
      "Cheat codes are usually activated by typing secret passwords or pressing controller buttons in a certain sequence.[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_video_games#cite_note-ingame-11) Less common activation methods include entering certain high score names, holding keys or buttons while dying, picking up items in a particular order and otherwise performing unintuitive actions. Some games may also offer a [debug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debug) console that can be used to edit game parameters. Effects might include unlocking a character or improving a character's performance: for example providing a car with greater acceleration,[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_video_games#cite_note-ingame-11) entering [god mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_video_game_terms#God_mode) or [noclip mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noclip_mode), unlimited money or ammunition, or just visual gags with no practical purpose, such as \"Tutu Qwark\" in [*Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratchet_%26_Clank:_Up_Your_Arsenal).\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike other cheating methods, cheat codes are implemented by the game developers themselves,[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_video_games#cite_note-sezen-10) often as a tool to playtest certain aspects of the game without difficulty. One of the earliest known examples of this type of cheat is the [Konami Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code), created in 1986 by Konami developer [Kazuhisa Hashimoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuhisa_Hashimoto) as he worked on [porting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting) the 1985 arcade game [*Gradius*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradius_(video_game)) for use on the [Nintendo Entertainment System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System). Hashimoto is quoted as saying \"The arcade version of *Gradius* is really difficult, right?

      "Cheating can easily be achieved by modifying the game's data while it is running. These methods of cheating are often less reliable than cheat codes included in a game by its creators. This is due to the fact that certain programming styles or quirks of internal game logic, different release versions of a game, or even using the same game at different times or on different hardware, may result in different memory usage and hence the trainer program might have no effect, or stop the game from running altogether.[\\[13\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_video_games#cite_note-13) Modifying game data usually constitutes a violation of a software license agreement that prohibits modifying the program at all. \n",

      "\n",
      "A cheat cartridge is attached to an interface port on a home computer or console. It allows a user to modify the game code either before or during its execution. An early example is the [Multiface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiface) for the ZX Spectrum, and almost every format since has had a cheat cartridge created for it; such as [Datel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datel)'s range of [Action Replay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Replay) devices. Another popular example of this is [Game Genie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Genie) for [Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Genesis), [NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System), [Super NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System), [Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy), and [Game Gear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Gear) game consoles. Modern disc-based cheat hardware includes [GameShark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameShark) and Code Breaker which modify the game code from a large database of cheats. In later generation consoles, cheat cartridges have come to be replaced by cheat discs, containing a simple loader program which loads a game disc and modifies the main executable before starting it.\n",

      "*Main article:* [*Trainer (games)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trainer_(games))\n",
      "\n",
      "The most basic way of achieving this is by means of memory editor software, which allows the player to directly edit the numeric values in a certain memory address. This kind of software usually includes a feature that allows the player to perform memory searches to aid the user to locate the memory areas where known values (such as the number of lives, score or health level) are located. Provided a memory address, a memory editor may also be able to \"freeze\" it, preventing the game from altering the information stored at that memory address.\n",
      "\n",
      "Game trainers are a special type of memory editor, in which the program comes with predefined functions to modify the [run time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_time_(program_lifecycle_phase)) memory of a specific [computer game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_game).[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_video_games#cite_note-about-14) When distributed, trainers often have a single + and a number appended to their title, representing the number of modifications the trainer has available.[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_video_games#cite_note-about-14)\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 1980s and 1990s, trainers were generally integrated straight into the actual game by [cracking groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_cracking). When the game was first started, the trainer would typically show a splash screen of its own, sometimes allowing modifications of options related to the trainer, and then proceed to the actual game. In the cracker group release lists and intros, trained games were marked with one or more plus signs after them, one for each option in the trainer, for example: \"the Mega Krew presents: *Ms. Astro Chicken++*\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Many emulators have built-in functionality that allows players to modify data as the game is running, sometimes even emulating cheating hardware such as [Game Genie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Genie). Some emulators take this method a step further and allow the player to export and import data edits. Edit templates of many games for a console are collected and redistributed as cheat packs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emulators also frequently offer the additional advantage of being able to save the state of the entire emulated machine at any point, effectively allowing saving at any point in a game even when save functionality is not provided by the game itself.

      "\n",
      "Somewhat more unusual than memory editing, code injection consists of the modification of the game's executable code while it is running, for example with the use of [POKE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEEK_and_POKE) commands. In the case of [*Jet Set Willy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Set_Willy) on the ZX Spectrum computer, a popular cheat involved replacing a [Z80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80) instruction DEC (HL)  \n",

      "\n",
      "[Hex editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_editor) were the most basic means of editing saved game files (e.g. to give the player a large sum of money in strategy games such as [*Dune II*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_II)). However, as happened with game editors, dedicated game-editing utilities soon became available, including functions to effortlessly edit saved data for specific games, rendering hex editing largely obsolete for this purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a saved game is stored in multiple files, it may also be possible to cheat simply by mixing and matching these files. For example, if one file represents the items in a treasure chest, while another represents the player's inventory, then the player can save the game before and after picking up an item from the chest, and continue play using the treasure chest file before the item was picked up, and the inventory file from afterward.\n",

      "A similar method for cheating in online games involves editing packets to modify outbound network traffic, thus affecting the state of the game. Although this was more common in the past, modern games are developed with robustness against network and packet modifications, and the terms of service for most games explicitly forbid this form of cheating.\n",

      "Cheat codes may sometimes produce unusual or interesting effects which don't necessarily make the game easier to play. For example, one cheat in [*Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park:_Operation_Genesis) makes dinosaurs appear \"[undead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undead)\". Another example occurs in the game [*Dungeon Siege*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Siege), where activating the cheat to extend the range of a bow also allows the enemies to fire at the same distance, thereby eliminating the advantage the cheat would have given. A cheat may even make the game harder to play; for instance, one could give the enemy special abilities, increase general difficulty, make neutral bystanders attack the player or grant the player a disadvantage such as low health points. Cheats in [*Grand Theft Auto*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto) games can make NPCs start rioting or wield weapons. In [*Grand Theft Auto III*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_III), the player can activate a cheat to enable blowing off the limbs of NPCs, a feature originally included in the game. Recently, however, [Rockstar Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockstar_Games) has not included such violent or unusual cheat codes in its games, instead choosing to focus on cheats such as vehicle spawns, player effects (for example, invincibility) and weapon spawns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some games humorously penalize the player for using another game's cheat codes. For example, using cheat codes from [*Doom*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)) in [*Descent*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_(video_game)) only displays sarcastic messages from the programmers on screen; using codes from *Descent* in its sequel [*Descent II*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_II) lowers the player's shields and energy to 1%.[\\[17\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_video_games#cite_note-descent2-17) Codes from *Doom* used in [*Heretic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heretic_(computer_game)) give the opposite of the desired effect, such as instant death instead of invulnerability or stripping weapons instead of providing them.[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_video_games#cite_note-18) The original *Doom*'s \"god mode\" code \"IDDQD\" is non-functional in [*Doom 3*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_3), but produces a console message: \"Your memory serves you well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Other codes make purely cosmetic changes—for example, to what the player character is wearing—but do not enhance the progress of the game. Most of the *Grand Theft Auto* games have a code to change the player character into an [NPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character). Other peculiar cheats may invoke \"big-head mode\" ([*GoldenEye 007*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoldenEye_007_(1997_video_game))[\\[19\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_video_games#cite_note-19)), replace weapons with other objects, or change the colors of characters.\n",

      "In games having attainable achievements or [high score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_score) records, or both, cheats by nature allow the player to attain achievements too easily or score point totals not attainable or extremely difficult to attain through legitimate means by a non-cheating player. In some games, [developer commentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_commentary#Video_games) mode can have the same effect because of these games, in an effort to make all commented-on scenarios accessible to the player, render a player invulnerable to damage while in commentary mode.\n",

      "Although the expected complaints of the USA are all valid, such as fair a lack of free health care, sensible minimum wages, fair labor laws, properly trained police, tuition-free college, and how frighteningly easy it is to access assault weapons, I am not going to focus on another problem with the nation which affects the everyday lives of everyone indiscriminately: car-centric infrastructure and city developments induced by America's avid car culture. This usually takes the form of financially insolvent car-dependent sprawl, the construction and expansion of freeways, city areas becoming extremely hostile towards pedestrians, the lack of funding given towards better transport alternatives, a decreased quality of life, and people being forced to buy a car for their everyday life. However, a car-dependent society also has side effects such as pollution with every motor vehicle in the US produces an average of 4.6 metric tons annually and have a much larger footprint even before they are ever driven (here is a video that describes this in greater detail: [national geographic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivdhpdqCQAA)) and is linked to consumerism which also has a massive carbon footprint (Here is a video describing this: [Our Changing Planet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omcUaD8pxaY&t=303s)); this, in turn, leads to negative health effects including heart and lung cancer (this source describes this in greater detail: [National Library of Medicine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9315815/), [Cleantechnia](https://cleantechnica.com/2012/03/09/care-about-your-heart-lungs-you-should-care-about-carbon-emissions-driving-costs-more-than-gas-prices-show/#:~:text=It's%20now%20clear%20that%20carbon,to%20heart%20and%20lung%20cancer)). It also forces the need for a car in your everyday life because car-centric usually have strict zoning laws which force people to use vehicles to travel to the store or work, even if they don't want to simply because there is no better alternative since cars create a hostile environment for bikes and slow down buses and other street-level public transport as well (however the street level issue seems to e a problem unique to The United States and Canada becuase they aren't given right of ways in order to move a larger amount of people faster). Another side effect is the expansion of massive fields of asphalt we call parking lots which further decrease walkability and waste space. \n",

      "Now, why is this something you should care about, after all, many cities (especially those on the Pacific coast, have car-centric single-family home urban sprawl woven into the fabric of their being which is really hard to change, especially if you aren't even able to vote; besides even if we all cared, the current political climate wouldn't be able to do anything about it anyway due to the massive backlash they would get from people who love their cars. It is true that that the current American political climate is unwilling to do anything about the avid car culture and the way the election system makes it really difficult for small parties to make it big, such as a green party which seemingly exists in every major European country. There really doesn't seem like there is anything any one person can do to help solve the problem, however, that isn't a reason to not care. besides, the city of Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands changed to be more bike-friendly quite recently (Here's a video describing that: [Bloomberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKbRL6Opifg)). Although Delft embraced the bicycle in 1979 (here is a video on that: [BicycleDutch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_MNThkMwQs)), it only really became the quiet and bike-filled paradise it is today quite recently, with some parts of the city center being loud and car infested as late as 2004. This shows how easy it can be to make changes to historic cities to become more people-friendly. Cities Like Philadelphia, Houston, San Fransisco, and maybe even Orlando can be rebuilt for people and not the car quite easily compared to cities like LA which have embraced the suburb hence requiring more work, however, it isn't impossible since it still has some remnants of the streetcar era which allowed it to become so car-centric (Here is a video to explain what I mean, however, I will elaborate later in the rant: [Not Just bikes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWsGBRdK2N0&t=411s)). Designing LA suburbs to be like Riverdale Toronto, would solve the need for cars while not eliminating the ability to use them, however, they are practically impossible to build due to US suburban-style development regulations such as street width requirements, setback requirements, strict zoning, and even front door amount requirements. Unwalkability decreases everyone's standard of living due to the inability to do free workouts such as jogging or biking without being in danger of being hit by a car, the need for a car, and highways that lengthen commutes, cause cancer and contribute to the heating climate. (On the topic of climate change, I will elaborate later on but here are videos stating some possible outcomes of climate change: [Atlas Pro ice age](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyAuWeoTm2s&t=672s), [Atlas pro sea levels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CurmnLKikyI), [Wendover Productions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfFvLJyPf3o&t=496s)). The Transportation sector in the US alone is responsible for 29% of the nation's carbon emissions, the most out of any sector(visit [EPA.gov](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions#:~:text=The%20largest%20source%20of%20greenhouse,Greenhouse%20Gas%20Emissions%20and%20Sinks) for more details), and cars are indisputably responsible for this. Trains, for example, are more energy-efficient, can carry a much larger amount of people or goods, and have a very straightforward electrification process which most nations have undergone to a significant extent, except for the US, with only the Northeast corridor having total electrification as of 2021 (I am not counting LTR or metro systems in this claim, only heavy rail). There is currently one electrification project which has made any significant progress, that being the Caltrain corridor, however, this has received much opposition and lacks proper funding due to the car-centric society we live in. The effects of a car-centric society make it more difficult to be physically fit, are dangerous for its inhabitants, decrease quality of life, lead to diseases such as lung and heart cancer, and contribute greatly to climate change; all these reasons are why you should care about living in and contributing to a car-centric society, becuase if you live in one, you are practically forced to contribute to one. Suburbs like Pitman New Jersey, Riverdale, Toronto, and cities like  New York City and Boston are examples of relatively walkable places which must be fought for if anyone is looking for a future with a good quality of living. However, the reasons you should care about stopping car dependency don't stop there.  \n",

      "America's car culture directly influences how cities are built and how people act, live, and think, all of which negatively affect everyone. The avid car culture forces everyone in the area to buy a car because every other mode of transportation such as public transport, biking, and walking are neglected and often completely destroyed. This increases noise in urban centers, decreases safety min suburbs becuase of a lack of crowd justice, forces everyone into cars, and can lead to depression due to a lack of social connection with people around you. This is something you should care about because it forces you to use a car, something which is very expensive due to maintenance and gas costs and increases your chance of dying in a commute using either your car or simply just walking or biking. This is the extent of the direct effects it has on your life for the most part however many more ways this affects your life indirectly. \n",

      "The main reason America adopted the car as the main mode of human commuting is because of their freedom to take a journey whenever, to wherever, and with whomever you wish. After the second world war, America left the great depression and entered an era of great economic prosperity when everyone could own a car and it seemed as though everyone could own a car, which created the basis of a car-centric society in which most Americans have been forced to live in. However, only a few amounts of people really want to use the car to go everywhere, everyone else simply just uses the best mode of transportation which, due to relentless government support for car-based public infrastructure just happens to be the car most of the time. This creates congested highways and streets which force officials to expand highways to combat its congestion; however, due to the economic principle of inducted demand (Watch this video for more information: [Pretzel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAezAGogWOI)) only ends up worsening the traffic situation in that area. The only way to combat the traffic problem is to introduce a better alternative to driving, such as introducing an electrified commuter rail corridor with fast vehicles with dwell times no longer than 30 seconds, high rates of acceleration and deceleration, and cost-competitive ticket prices. However, the most important trait of a transport system like this is that it needs to provide safe and reliable travel with short enough waiting times, preferably 3 minutes around rush hour, so people don't have to wait long periods of time for their train and can step on the platform literally whenever they want. As you can see, a public transport option like the one I just mentioned also addresses many desires avid car drivers want from their car, freedom to leave on their journey whenever they want, a level of privacy while traveling due to separation by the backs of seats which also addresses another of the desires they wat form a car: the desire to travel with whomever they want; to add on, as soon as the transport network becomes dense enough, with routes connecting the entire area, people will be able to travel wherever they want as well. Any sane public official would look at a proposed commuter / light rail service or metro line and instantly choose it over a highway expansion connecting the same city to suburb/ suburb to suburb, however, as seen, again and again, any proposal for public transport infrastructure will instantly be fought off by people yelling communism and death threats being sent to the official who proposed the idea. \n",

      "**\\[TLDR: America adopted its car culture after the closing of WWII when the nation was experiencing great economic prosperity and the car became very cheap.

      "If a nation adopts an avid car culture, once beautiful cities will be adapted to fit the car through massive destruction of property in order to fit massive roadways, parking lots, and other car utilities. And, in the United States and Canada, they aren't restricted to a sensible speed limit of 20 mph in Urban areas, which causes the amount of noise a car produces to drastically increase above the acceptable noise limit in a city of 55 decibels DBA (this video can explain this in greater detail: [Not Just Bikes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTV-wwszGw8&list=TLPQMjYwNzIwMjHXoAbWUKOxRA&index=12)). This causes loss of sleep which has side effects such as stress, obesity, and mass exoduses to the suburbs in order to get away from the noise. This leads to people using their cars to get into the city center for work which in turn leads to longer commutes meaning ore car traffic on the highways, which means more noise, which causes the cycle to repeat. This also leads to suburban expansion, which is probably one of the worst things in existence due to the growth Ponzi scheme (which you can get a better understanding of by watching this video: [Not Just Bikes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IsMeKl-Sv0)). Suburban developments are also inherently worse than traditional developments (this video can explain this in greater detail: [Not Just bikes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUeqxXwCA0&list=TLPQMjYwNzIwMjHXoAbWUKOxRA&index=4)) which in turn leads to many places becoming unwalkable thanks to strip-malls(Watch this video if you want to learn more: [Alan Fisher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNa35Fubm4Q&t=343s)) and the disgusting stroad (Watch this video to learn more: [Not Just Bikes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORzNZUeUHAM&list=TLPQMjYwNzIwMjHXoAbWUKOxRA&index=5) p.s. Sorry for the heavy reliance on Not Just Bikes content, he is just very effective at conveying information). Now, I would like to say that I am merely hating on car-dependent, cul-da-sack style suburbs with strict zoning laws which lead to the construction of single-family homes, there are ways to properly construct suburbs in order to avoid all the problems American suburbs usually face, streetcar suburbs are the best notable example. Streetcar suburbs are suburbs built around a streetcar line that provide density without making it feel dense. Instead of having large schools where everyone goes, they have smaller schools people can walk to. There are several arguments for suburbs, including the noise arguments debunked in an earlier part of the paragraph, the idea that it is supposed to make raising children easier and improve the lives of children (something which I don't buy for several reasons such as roads feel more dangerous, distances between locations are much longer making walkability harder for someone who doesn't or can't drive, the fact that streets often feel dead due to the lack of activity, especially in Western American suburbs, and arguments made by this video: [Not Just bikes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul_xzyCDT98&t=79s)). However, car-dependent Suburban development, in turn, produces the demand for freeway infrastructure which has been proved to have severe health effects on people living close to them due to the immense pollution produced by traffic which can only e fixed by the creation of public transport due to the economic principle of induced demand (these videos explain these phenomena in greater detail: [City Beautiful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbiI9ainetY&t=445s) and [Vox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z7o3sRxA5g)). This traffic creates demand for the construction of stupid public transport systems commonly referred to as gadgetbahns such as the boring company, the hyperloop, and several others, however, this isn't the topic of this rant so I will just post resources explaining this by Adam Something right here: \\[[Boring Company Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXaFyB_-8s), [Skybus (Miami metro mover) video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1-32Y2wADo&t=13s), [Hyperloop killer (American rail club)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XFMIqiDWAc), [Hyperloop problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQJgFh_e01g), [International space flights video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQUiIdre-MI), [skyscraper video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXZ_0wOY96E), and [(CPG Grey Reaction) Traffic video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oafm733nI6U&t=561s)\\]. Suburban is connected to America's avid car culture due to their pedestrian discriminant and car-centric design through the adoption of the cul-da sack, a road construction design that makes public transport implementation impossible and is built to be as cheap as possible making it more difficult to just walk everywhere. This forces people that wanna walk into the cars because of the dangerous environment created, and makes it seem as though everyone wants to use a car.  Car-dependent suburbs are also strictly zoned which forces people to drive everywhere becuase commercial and residential areas have been separated. Designing a mixed-use suburb centered around an LTR or metro stop with several traffic calming methods installed can help get more people out of cars and help tear down the car-centric society most Americans live in right now. The design would be relatively simple, the center would entail the public transport connection with a library and high school very close to the general area, if these things were at the center of the suburb it would minimize the commute time to reach the area for everyone in the suburb in general. The center would also have a medical center, post office, bank, and police, and fire station while elementary and middle schools would be located out of the suburban center in greater numbers. The general suburban area would consist of a mixture of single-family homes, apartment complexes, commercial space, and mixed-use buildings which can help smaller businesses flourish since people don't have to drive to the nearest big-box store. Suburbs, in general, are not bad, car-centric suburbs influenced by a very prevalent car culture on the contrary are. Now that my mini-rant to f sorts on car-dependent suburbs is complete, I would like to change my attention to another part of this rabbit which is American Car Culture.\n",

      "**\\[TLDR: Car dependency increases the noise in a city above WHO recommendations and leads people to move out of the city center into the suburbs and commute into the city center for work which increases noise and leads to a repeating cycle which worsens traffic and expands highways, which produce more pollution.** \n",

      "Cars have a very damaging climate impact wherever they drive, if a car moves at a constant speed for a mile, they end up producing an average of 411 grams of CO2 per mile. An average of 253 million cars is on US roads at 1 time, averaging 11.4 years old. This means an average of 103,990 metric tons of carbon dioxide is released into the air in the US per mile driven.  However, this number is likely higher because as cars age, they tend to produce more carbon per mile. This is massive compared to rail travel, according to the EEA, trains produce 14 grams of co2 per passenger mile, which is nothing compared to the 258 grams of co2 produced by planes every passenger mile, and 158 grams produced by cars per passenger mile. In the US, trains produce 55 grams of CO2 per mile and there are 31,875 total locomotives in the US. Assuming half of all locomotives are on the US rail network at one time, 0.8765625 metric tons of CO2 are produced by all locomotives per mile traveled. Not even a single metric ton of CO2 is produced by trains in the USA, even when the US has the largest freight rail network in the world and the rail network moves 28% of all US freight. And we can decrease this amount even further through the use of electrification of the rail network. Since the US moves freight mainly in a double-stacked configuration and often doesn't move at all to high speeds, adding a live rail to the tracks which provide power to the trains through the use of a shoe which collects electricity, the overall carbon emissions would be reduced and the surrounding area wouldn't even be polluted at all. This would also quiet down the train locomotives, something you can't do with cars; and with the added attribute that steel train wheels produce less sound than car tires, and thousands of other positives of switching to the railroad, improving rail l infrastructure doesn't have any negatives. The privatization of the rail network where separate companies own their own tracks and are often in completion is probably the biggest factor that contributes to an unreliable rail network becuase for most of the US, passenger trains have to yield to freight trains. here are several upsides to nationalization, such as the sensible thing that passenger trains get priority over freight trains which increases reliability, decreases travel times, and gets more people out of it cars, smaller settlements would end up being served by both freight and passenger services, which decreases the need for trucks and cars, massive decisions can be made network-wide which can benefit everyone such as complete electrification. The only way to solve car dependency is to provide a better alternative to driving, something which will improve living conditions, decrease carbon emissions, and solve traffic problems.\n",

I blew my own mind about how diverse the world is. Most of us here are probably lucky that we are able to have blessings & privileges in our life such as education, a loving family, supportive friends, literacy, wealth, health, & connection to the outside world. I kept thinking about those kids who aren't able to go to school, read, operate simple machines, communicate effectively, and freedom to explore. And here we are, some of us take school for granted, they don't even care for their grades. A teacher of mine once said that there are more worthy children/teens to replace each of the students in their respective chairs in the classroom. Come to think of it, those who aren't able to go to school would do ANYTHING just to study. They would cross rivers and mountains just so they could go to their hard to reach school(Common scenario here in the provinces of the Philippines). That's why I would do anything to make an impact and leave a trace of my existence and contribution while I'm still alive. For me, life is where I can contribute to innovation and help other people.

Or to stay where I’m not that known but have more chances of exploring myself?” It made me realize…If you’re one of the best students in your school, you might be nothing compared to the students in the other schools… just sayin.\n",

      "Title: The Industrial Revolution and its consequences\n",
      "Content: The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.\n",
      "2. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy.\n",
      "3. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later.\n",
      "4. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can’t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society.\n",
      "5. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important.\n",
      "THE PSYCHOLOGY OF MODERN LEFTISM\n",
      "6. Almost everyone will agree that we live in a deeply troubled society. One of the most widespread manifestations of the craziness of our world is leftism, so a discussion of the psychology of leftism can serve as an introduction to the discussion of the problems of modern society in general.\n",
      "7. But what is leftism? During the first half of the 20th century leftism could have been practically identified with socialism. Today the movement is fragmented and it is not clear who can properly be called a leftist. When we speak of leftists in this article we have in mind mainly socialists, collectivists, “politically correct” types, feminists, gay and disability activists, animal rights activists and the like. But not everyone who is associated with one of these movements is a leftist. What we are trying to get at in discussing leftism is not so much movement or an ideology as a psychological type, or rather a collection of related types. Thus, what we mean by “leftism” will emerge more clearly in the course of our discussion of leftist psychology. (Also, see paragraphs 227-230.)\n",
      "8. Even so, our conception of leftism will remain a good deal less clear than we would wish, but there doesn’t seem to be any remedy for this. All we are trying to do here is indicate in a rough and approximate way the two psychological tendencies that we believe are the main driving force of modern leftism. We by no means claim to be telling the WHOLE truth about leftist psychology. Also, our discussion is meant to apply to modern leftism only. We leave open the question of the extent to which our discussion could be applied to the leftists of the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n",
      "9. The two psychological tendencies that underlie modern leftism we call “feelings of inferiority” and “oversocialization.” Feelings of inferiority are characteristic of modern leftism as a whole, while oversocialization is characteristic only of a certain segment of modern leftism; but this segment is highly influential.\n",
      "FEELINGS OF INFERIORITY\n",
      "10. By “feelings of inferiority” we mean not only inferiority feelings in the strict sense but a whole spectrum of related traits; low self-esteem, feelings of powerlessness, depressive tendencies, defeatism, guilt, self- hatred, etc. We argue that modern leftists tend to have some such feelings (possibly more or less repressed) and that these feelings are decisive in determining the direction of modern leftism.\n",
      "11. When someone interprets as derogatory almost anything that is said about him (or about groups with whom he identifies) we conclude that he has inferiority feelings or low self-esteem. This tendency is pronounced among minority rights activists, whether or not they belong to the minority groups whose rights they defend. They are hypersensitive about the words used to designate minorities and about anything that is said concerning minorities. The terms “negro,” “oriental,” “handicapped” or “chick” for an African, an Asian, a disabled person or a woman originally had no derogatory connotation. “Broad” and “chick” were merely the feminine equivalents of “guy,” “dude” or “fellow.” The negative connotations have been attached to these terms by the activists themselves. Some animal rights activists have gone so far as to reject the word “pet” and insist on its replacement by “animal companion.” Leftish anthropologists go to great lengths to avoid saying anything about primitive peoples that could conceivably be interpreted as negative. They want to replace the world “primitive” by “nonliterate.” They seem almost paranoid about anything that might suggest that any primitive culture is inferior to our own. (We do not mean to imply that primitive cultures ARE inferior to ours. We merely point out the hypersensitivity of leftish anthropologists.)\n",
      "12. Those who are most sensitive about “politically incorrect” terminology are not the average black ghetto- dweller, Asian immigrant, abused woman or disabled person, but a minority of activists, many of whom do not even belong to any “oppressed” group but come from privileged strata of society. Political correctness has its stronghold among university professors, who have secure employment with comfortable salaries, and the majority of whom are heterosexual white males from middle- to upper-middle-class families.\n",
      "13. Many leftists have an intense identification with the problems of groups that have an image of being weak (women), defeated (American Indians), repellent (homosexuals) or otherwise inferior. The leftists themselves feel that these groups are inferior. They would never admit to themselves that they have such feelings, but it is precisely because they do see these groups as inferior that they identify with their problems. (We do not mean to suggest that women, Indians, etc. ARE inferior; we are only making a point about leftist psychology.)\n",
      "14. Feminists are desperately anxious to prove that women are as strong and as capable as men. Clearly they are nagged by a fear that women may NOT be as strong and as capable as men.\n",
      "15. Leftists tend to hate anything that has an image of being strong, good and successful. They hate America, they hate Western civilization, they hate white males, they hate rationality. The reasons that leftists give for hating the West, etc. clearly do not correspond with their real motives. They SAY they hate the West because it is warlike, imperialistic, sexist, ethnocentric and so forth, but where these same faults appear in socialist countries or in primitive cultures, the leftist finds excuses for them, or at best he GRUDGINGLY admits that they exist; whereas he ENTHUSIASTICALLY points out (and often greatly exaggerates) these faults where they appear in Western civilization. Thus it is clear that these faults are not the leftist’s real motive for hating America and the West. He hates America and the West because they are strong and successful.\n",
      "16. Words like “self-confidence,” “self-reliance,” “initiative,” “enterprise,” “optimism,” etc., play little role in the liberal and leftist vocabulary. The leftist is anti-individualistic, pro-collectivist. He wants society to solve everyone’s problems for them, satisfy everyone’s needs for them, take care of them. He is not the sort of person who has an inner sense of confidence in his ability to solve his own problems and satisfy his own needs. The leftist is antagonistic to the concept of competition because, deep inside, he feels like a loser.\n",
      "17. Art forms that appeal to modern leftish intellectuals tend to focus on sordidness, defeat and despair, or else they take an orgiastic tone, throwing off rational control as if there were no hope of accomplishing anything through rational calculation and all that was left was to immerse oneself in the sensations of the moment.\n",
      "18. Modern leftish philosophers tend to dismiss reason, science, objective reality and to insist that everything is culturally relative. It is true that one can ask serious questions about the foundations of scientific knowledge and about how, if at all, the concept of objective reality can be defined. But it is obvious that modern leftish philosophers are not simply cool-headed logicians systematically analyzing the foundations of knowledge. They are deeply involved emotionally in their attack on truth and reality. They attack these concepts because of their own psychological needs. For one thing, their attack is an outlet for hostility, and, to the extent that it is successful, it satisfies the drive for power. More importantly, the leftist hates science and rationality because they classify certain beliefs as true (i.e., successful, superior) and other beliefs as false (i.e., failed, inferior). The leftist’s feelings of inferiority run so deep that he cannot tolerate any classification of some things as successful or superior and other things as failed or inferior. This also underlies the rejection by many leftists of the concept of mental illness and of the utility of IQ tests. Leftists are antagonistic to genetic explanations of human abilities or behavior because such explanations tend to make some persons appear superior or inferior to others. Leftists prefer to give society the credit or blame for an individual’s ability or lack of it. Thus if a person is “inferior” it is not his fault, but society’s, because he has not been brought up properly.\n",
      "19. The leftist is not typically the kind of person whose feelings of inferiority make him a braggart, an egotist, a bully, a self-promoter, a ruthless competitor. This kind of person has not wholly lost faith in himself. He has a deficit in his sense of power and self-worth, but he can still conceive of himself as having the capacity to be strong, and his efforts to make himself strong produce his unpleasant behavior. [1] But the leftist is too far gone for that. His feelings of inferiority are so ingrained that he cannot conceive of himself as individually strong and valuable. Hence the collectivism of the leftist. He can feel strong only as a member of a large organization or a mass movement with which he identifies himself.\n",
      "20. Notice the masochistic tendency of leftist tactics. Leftists protest by lying down in front of vehicles, they intentionally provoke police or racists to abuse them, etc. These tactics may often be effective, but many leftists use them not as a means to an end but because they PREFER masochistic tactics. Self-hatred is a leftist trait.\n",
      "21. Leftists may claim that their activism is motivated by compassion or by moral principles, and moral principle does play a role for the leftist of the oversocialized type. But compassion and moral principle cannot be the main motives for leftist activism. Hostility is too prominent a component of leftist behavior; so is the drive for power. Moreover, much leftist behavior is not rationally calculated to be of benefit to the people whom the leftists claim to be trying to help. For example, if one believes that affirmative action is good for black people, does it make sense to demand affirmative action in hostile or dogmatic terms? Obviously it would be more productive to take a diplomatic and conciliatory approach that would make at least verbal and symbolic concessions to white people who think that affirmative action discriminates against them. But leftist activists do not take such an approach because it would not satisfy their emotional needs. Helping black people is not their real goal. Instead, race problems serve as an excuse for them to express their own hostility and frustrated need for power. In doing so they actually harm black people, because the activists’ hostile attitude toward the white majority tends to intensify race hatred.\n",
      "22. If our society had no social problems at all, the leftists would have to INVENT problems in order to provide themselves with an excuse for making a fuss.\n",
      "23. We emphasize that the foregoing does not pretend to be an accurate description of everyone who might be considered a leftist. It is only a rough indication of a general tendency of leftism.\n",
      "OVERSOCIALIZATION\n",
      "24. Psychologists use the term “socialization” to designate the process by which children are trained to think and act as society demands. A person is said to be well socialized if he believes in and obeys the moral code of his society and fits in well as a functioning part of that society. It may seem senseless to say that many leftists are oversocialized, since the leftist is perceived as a rebel. Nevertheless, the position can be defended. Many leftists are not such rebels as they seem.\n",
      "25. The moral code of our society is so demanding that no one can think, feel and act in a completely moral way. For example, we are not supposed to hate anyone, yet almost everyone hates somebody at some time or other, whether he admits it to himself or not. Some people are so highly socialized that the attempt to think, feel and act morally imposes a severe burden on them. In order to avoid feelings of guilt, they continually have to deceive themselves about their own motives and find moral explanations for feelings and actions that in reality have a non-moral origin. We use the term “oversocialized” to describe such people. [2]\n",
      "26. Oversocialization can lead to low self-esteem, a sense of powerlessness, defeatism, guilt, etc. One of the most important means by which our society socializes children is by making them feel ashamed of behavior or speech that is contrary to society’s expectations. If this is overdone, or if a particular child is especially susceptible to such feelings, he ends by feeling ashamed of HIMSELF. Moreover the thought and the behavior of the oversocialized person are more restricted by society’s expectations than are those of the lightly socialized person. The majority of people engage in a significant amount of naughty behavior. They lie, they commit petty thefts, they break traffic laws, they goof off at work, they hate someone, they say spiteful things or they use some underhanded trick to get ahead of the other guy. The oversocialized person cannot do these things, or if he does do them he generates in himself a sense of shame and self-hatred. The oversocialized person cannot even experience, without guilt, thoughts or feelings that are contrary to the accepted morality; he cannot think “unclean” thoughts. And socialization is not just a matter of morality; we are socialized to conform to many norms of behavior that do not fall under the heading of morality. Thus the oversocialized person is kept on a psychological leash and spends his life running on rails that society has laid down for him. In many oversocialized people this results in a sense of constraint and powerlessness that can be a severe hardship. We suggest that oversocialization is among the more serious cruelties that human beings inflict on one another.\n",
      "27. We argue that a very important and influential segment of the modern left is oversocialized and that their oversocialization is of great importance in determining the direction of modern leftism. Leftists of the oversocialized type tend to be intellectuals or members of the upper-middle class. Notice that university intellectuals [3] constitute the most highly socialized segment of our society and also the most left-wing segment.\n",
      "28. The leftist of the oversocialized type tries to get off his psychological leash and assert his autonomy by rebelling. But usually he is not strong enough to rebel against the most basic values of society. Generally speaking, the goals of today’s leftists are NOT in conflict with the accepted morality. On the contrary, the left takes an accepted moral principle, adopts it as its own, and then accuses mainstream society of violating that principle. Examples: racial equality, equality of the sexes, helping poor people, peace as opposed to war, nonviolence generally, freedom of expression, kindness to animals. More fundamentally, the duty of the individual to serve society and the duty of society to take care of the individual. All these have been deeply rooted values of our society (or at least of its middle and upper classes [4] for a long time. These values are explicitly or implicitly expressed or presupposed in most of the material presented to us by the mainstream communications media and the educational system. Leftists, especially those of the oversocialized type, usually do not rebel against these principles but justify their hostility to society by claiming (with some degree of truth) that society is not living up to these principles.\n",
      "29. Here is an illustration of the way in which the oversocialized leftist shows his real attachment to the conventional attitudes of our society while pretending to be in rebellion against it. Many leftists push for affirmative action, for moving black people into high-prestige jobs, for improved education in black schools and more money for such schools; the way of life of the black “underclass” they regard as a social disgrace. They want to integrate the black man into the system, make him a business executive, a lawyer, a scientist just like upper-middle-class white people. The leftists will reply that the last thing they want is to make the black man into a copy of the white man; instead, they want to preserve African American culture. But in what does this preservation of African American culture consist? It can hardly consist in anything more than eating black-style food, listening to black-style music, wearing black-style clothing and going to a black- style church or mosque. In other words, it can express itself only in superficial matters. In all ESSENTIAL respects most leftists of the oversocialized type want to make the black man conform to white, middle-class ideals. They want to make him study technical subjects, become an executive or a scientist, spend his life climbing the status ladder to prove that black people are as good as white. They want to make black fathers “responsible,” they want black gangs to become nonviolent, etc. But these are exactly the values of the industrial-technological system. The system couldn’t care less what kind of music a man listens to, what kind of clothes he wears or what religion he believes in as long as he studies in school, holds a respectable job, climbs the status ladder, is a “responsible” parent, is nonviolent and so forth. In effect, however much he may deny it, the oversocialized leftist wants to integrate the black man into the system and make him adopt its values.\n",
      "30. We certainly do not claim that leftists, even of the oversocialized type, NEVER rebel against the fundamental values of our society. Clearly they sometimes do. Some oversocialized leftists have gone so far as to rebel against one of modern society’s most important principles by engaging in physical violence. By their own account, violence is for them a form of “liberation.” In other words, by committing violence they break through the psychological restraints that have been trained into them. Because they are oversocialized these restraints have been more confining for them than for others; hence their need to break free of them. But they usually justify their rebellion in terms of mainstream values. If they engage in violence they claim to be fighting against racism or the like.\n",
      "31. We realize that many objections could be raised to the foregoing thumbnail sketch of leftist psychology. The real situation is complex, and anything like a complete description of it would take several volumes even if the necessary data were available. We claim only to have indicated very roughly the two most important tendencies in the psychology of modern leftism.\n",
      "32. The problems of the leftist are indicative of the problems of our society as a whole. Low self-esteem, depressive tendencies and defeatism are not restricted to the left. Though they are especially noticeable in the left, they are widespread in our society. And today’s society tries to socialize us to a greater extent than any previous society. We are even told by experts how to eat, how to exercise, how to make love, how to raise our kids and so forth.\n",
      "THE POWER PROCESS\n",
      "33. Human beings have a need (probably based in biology) for something that we will call the “power process.” This is closely related to the need for power (which is widely recognized) but is not quite the same thing. The power process has four elements. The three most clear-cut of these we call goal, effort and attainment of goal. (Everyone needs to have goals whose attainment requires effort, and needs to succeed in attaining at least some of his goals.) The fourth element is more difficult to define and may not be necessary for everyone. We call it autonomy and will discuss it later (paragraphs 42-44).\n",
      "34. Consider the hypothetical case of a man who can have anything he wants just by wishing for it. Such a man has power, but he will develop serious psychological problems. At first he will have a lot of fun, but by and by he will become acutely bored and demoralized. Eventually he may become clinically depressed. History shows that leisured aristocracies tend to become decadent. This is not true of fighting aristocracies that have to struggle to maintain their power. But leisured, secure aristocracies that have no need to exert themselves usually become bored, hedonistic and demoralized, even though they have power. This shows that power is not enough. One must have goals toward which to exercise one’s power.\n",
      "35. Everyone has goals; if nothing else, to obtain the physical necessities of life: food, water and whatever clothing and shelter are made necessary by the climate. But the leisured aristocrat obtains these things without effort. Hence his boredom and demoralization.\n",
      "36. Nonattainment of important goals results in death if the goals are physical necessities, and in frustration if nonattainment of the goals is compatible with survival. Consistent failure to attain goals throughout life results in defeatism, low self-esteem or depression.\n",
      "37, Thus, in order to avoid serious psychological problems, a human being needs goals whose attainment requires effort, and he must have a reasonable rate of success in attaining his goals.\n",
      "SURROGATE ACTIVITIES\n",
      "38. But not every leisured aristocrat becomes bored and demoralized. For example, the emperor Hirohito, instead of sinking into decadent hedonism, devoted himself to marine biology, a field in which he became distinguished. When people do not have to exert themselves to satisfy their physical needs they often set up artificial goals for themselves. In many cases they then pursue these goals with the same energy and emotional involvement that they otherwise would have put into the search for physical necessities. Thus the aristocrats of the Roman Empire had their literary pretensions; many European aristocrats a few centuries ago invested tremendous time and energy in hunting, though they certainly didn’t need the meat; other aristocracies have competed for status through elaborate displays of wealth; and a few aristocrats, like Hirohito, have turned to science.\n",
      "39. We use the term “surrogate activity” to designate an activity that is directed toward an artificial goal that people set up for themselves merely in order to have some goal to work toward, or let us say, merely for the sake of the “fulfillment” that they get from pursuing the goal. Here is a rule of thumb for the identification of surrogate activities. Given a person who devotes much time and energy to the pursuit of goal X, ask yourself this: If he had to devote most of his time and energy to satisfying his biological needs, and if that effort required him to use his physical and mental faculties in a varied and interesting way, would he feel seriously deprived because he did not attain goal X? If the answer is no, then the person’s pursuit of goal X is a surrogate activity. Hirohito’s studies in marine biology clearly constituted a surrogate activity, since it is pretty certain that if Hirohito had had to spend his time working at interesting non-scientific tasks in order to obtain the necessities of life, he would not have felt deprived because he didn’t know all about the anatomy and life-cycles of marine animals. On the other hand the pursuit of sex and love (for example) is not a surrogate activity, because most people, even if their existence were otherwise satisfactory, would feel deprived if they passed their lives without ever having a relationship with a member of the opposite sex. (But pursuit of an excessive amount of sex, more than one really needs, can be a surrogate activity.)\n",
      "40. In modern industrial society only minimal effort is necessary to satisfy one’s physical needs. It is enough to go through a training program to acquire some petty technical skill, then come to work on time and exert the very modest effort needed to hold a job. The only requirements are a moderate amount of intelligence and, most of all, simple OBEDIENCE. If one has those, society takes care of one from cradle to grave. (Yes, there is an underclass that cannot take the physical necessities for granted, but we are speaking here of mainstream society.) Thus it is not surprising that modern society is full of surrogate activities. These include scientific work, athletic achievement, humanitarian work, artistic and literary creation, climbing the corporate ladder, acquisition of money and material goods far beyond the point at which they cease to give any additional physical satisfaction, and social activism when it addresses issues that are not important for the activist personally, as in the case of white activists who work for the rights of nonwhite minorities. These are not always PURE surrogate activities, since for many people they may be motivated in part by needs other than the need to have some goal to pursue. Scientific work may be motivated in part by a drive for prestige, artistic creation by a need to express feelings, militant social activism by hostility. But for most people who pursue them, these activities are in large part surrogate activities. For example, the majority of scientists will probably agree that the “fulfillment” they get from their work is more important than the money and prestige they earn.\n",
      "41. For many if not most people, surrogate activities are less satisfying than the pursuit of real goals (that is, goals that people would want to attain even if their need for the power process were already fulfilled). One indication of this is the fact that, in many or most cases, people who are deeply involved in surrogate activities are never satisfied, never at rest. Thus the money-maker constantly strives for more and more wealth. The scientist no sooner solves one problem than he moves on to the next. The long-distance runner drives himself to run always farther and faster. Many people who pursue surrogate activities will say that they get far more fulfillment from these activities than they do from the “mundane” business of satisfying their biological needs, but that is because in our society the effort needed to satisfy the biological needs has been reduced to triviality. More importantly, in our society people do not satisfy their biological needs AUTONOMOUSLY but by functioning as parts of an immense social machine. In contrast, people generally have a great deal of autonomy in pursuing their surrogate activities.\n",
      "AUTONOMY\n",
      "42. Autonomy as a part of the power process may not be necessary for every individual. But most people need a greater or lesser degree of autonomy in working toward their goals. Their efforts must be undertaken on their own initiative and must be under their own direction and control. Yet most people do not have to exert this initiative, direction and control as single individuals. It is usually enough to act as a member of a SMALL group. Thus if half a dozen people discuss a goal among themselves and make a successful joint effort to attain that goal, their need for the power process will be served. But if they work under rigid orders handed down from above that leave them no room for autonomous decision and initiative, then their need for the power process will not be served. The same is true when decisions are made on a collective basis if the group making the collective decision is so large that the role of each individual is insignificant. [5]\n",
      "43. It is true that some individuals seem to have little need for autonomy. Either their drive for power is weak or they satisfy it by identifying themselves with some powerful organization to which they belong. And then there are unthinking, animal types who seem to be satisfied with a purely physical sense of power (the good combat soldier, who gets his sense of power by developing fighting skills that he is quite content to use in blind obedience to his superiors).\n",
      "44. But for most people it is through the power process—having a goal, making an AUTONOMOUS effort and attaining the goal—that self-esteem, self-confidence and a sense of power are acquired. When one does not have adequate opportunity to go through the power process the consequences are (depending on the individual and on the way the power process is disrupted) boredom, demoralization, low self-esteem, inferiority feelings, defeatism, depression, anxiety, guilt, frustration, hostility, spouse or child abuse, insatiable hedonism, abnormal sexual behavior, sleep disorders, eating disorders, etc. [6]\n",
      "SOURCES OF SOCIAL PROBLEMS\n",
      "45. Any of the foregoing symptoms can occur in any society, but in modern industrial society they are present on a massive scale. We aren’t the first to mention that the world today seems to be going crazy. This sort of thing is not normal for human societies. There is good reason to believe that primitive man suffered from less stress and frustration and was better satisfied with his way of life than modern man is. It is true that not all was sweetness and light in primitive societies. Abuse of women was common among the Australian aborigines, transexuality was fairly common among some of the American Indian tribes. But it does appear that GENERALLY SPEAKING the kinds of problems that we have listed in the preceding paragraph were far less common among primitive peoples than they are in modern society.\n",
      "46. We attribute the social and psychological problems of modern society to the fact that that society requires people to live under conditions radically different from those under which the human race evolved and to behave in ways that conflict with the patterns of behavior that the human race developed while living under the earlier conditions. It is clear from what we have already written that we consider lack of opportunity to properly experience the power process as the most important of the abnormal conditions to which modern society subjects people. But it is not the only one. Before dealing with disruption of the power process as a source of social problems we will discuss some of the other sources.\n",
      "47. Among the abnormal conditions present in modern industrial society are excessive density of population, isolation of man from nature, excessive rapidity of social change and the breakdown of natural small-scale communities such as the extended family, the village or the tribe.\n",
      "48. It is well known that crowding increases stress and aggression. The degree of crowding that exists today and the isolation of man from nature are consequences of technological progress. All pre-industrial societies were predominantly rural. The Industrial Revolution vastly increased the size of cities and the proportion of the population that lives in them, and modern agricultural technology has made it possible for the Earth to support a far denser population than it ever did before. (Also, technology exacerbates the effects of crowding because it puts increased disruptive powers in people’s hands. For example, a variety of noise- making devices: power mowers, radios, motorcycles, etc. If the use of these devices is unrestricted, people who want peace and quiet are frustrated by the noise. If their use is restricted, people who use the devices are frustrated by the regulations. But if these machines had never been invented there would have been no conflict and no frustration generated by them.)\n",
      "49. For primitive societies the natural world (which usually changes only slowly) provided a stable framework and therefore a sense of security. In the modern world it is human society that dominates nature rather than the other way around, and modern society changes very rapidly owing to technological change. Thus there is no ssociety.\n",

      "This is part 2 of the response, so if you haven’t read part 1, I recommend you do. As a recap, I just destroyed Ben’s “what is a woman” argument, and according to him, I won the debate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Continuing on as part of his statement on the “what is a woman” train of thought, he adds that “for advocates of biology, the answer for ‘what is a woman’ or ‘what is a man’ is simple. We can look at chromosomes, SRY genes, reproductive systems. Verifiable answers to the question.” I find this interesting, first things first, he starts by saying “for advocates of biology the answer is simple”, but biologists seem to disagree with him. And as he’s famous for his disavowment of higher education, and general hatred towards biology and science, it seems ironic coming from him. The question is simple for advocates of biology, they all agree with me, so it’s weird that that’s the phraseology he would choose to use. Then he says that the answer is simple, but fails to actually provide one, I think that’s kinda interesting. “The answer is simple”, then why not give the answer? If it’s so simple and easy to define man and woman, why aren’t you able to do it? Are you admitting that whilst for advocates of biology it’s easy, for you it isn’t? All he says afterwards is that “we can look at chromosomes, SRY genes, and reproductive systems”, but that isn’t a definition, that’s just saying things we can do. Also, you yourself brought up chromosomal abnormalities literally earlier in this video, so clearly there are exceptions to your definition. So, logistically, trans people are just one of those exceptions, in general his definition is accurate, but sometimes people don’t perfectly meet it and are still in those categories. This man somehow manages to make an entire well-funded video that he had lots of time to think out, and yet debunks himself constantly throughout it. In reality, Bentarou Satomi can’t actually find a single defining feature for the word woman that there can’t be found an exception to within cis women, and because of that, the argument can be instantly made that trans women just also are part of that exception. That’s why he refuses to answer the question, despite the fact that it’s supposedly such a simple and easy answer. The best he could do would be “a member of the female sex”, but that’s just as good as “someone who’s gender is female”, so that would debunk himself too, and of course there’s no way he’s gonna be able to define what makes someone a part of the female sex, I mean there’s still debate as to where the line of the bimodal distribution is drawn, so to even acknowledge it would be to acknowledge that his previous points were wrong. He can give some basic ideas, but I already went over those, so not much point in covering them again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, what’s next, baby? We’ve got him now saying that according to medical activists, “gender and sex are completely separate”, and that it’s all because “science is a fallacy, and there is no separation between gender and sex.” He goes on to say the same basic thing a few more times, always making sure to take it to its logical extreme, as if he just doesn’t want to bother arguing with anything else. Supposedly, advocates of biology think that there’s literally not a single correlative aspect between gender and sex (which he acted earlier as if they agreed with him, I don’t know why he’s doing this whole flip-floppy thing where sometimes the so called ‘advocates of biology’ hate trans people and science, and sometimes they like it, but okay). He continues to once again reiterate this, I don’t know why he feels the need to say it three times, but that’s fine I guess, all we know is that according to him, trans activists think that there’s no correlation at any level between sex and gender. A thing that… definitely isn’t true? I guess he’s just unwilling to present realistic arguments because he’s scared he’ll lose against the fake person he’s created to argue with, but yeah no one thinks that. This time, this can’t be a simple slip of the tongue. I’ve been willing to excuse some things on the assumption that this video is unscripted and mostly unedited, and that he only recorded it once, so he might’ve just said something wrong, but in this case that’s clearly not the case. He made this wrong point several times in a row, making sure to clarify that he’s remarkably stupid. Now, maybe there’s like, I dunno, five people who might think this, but it’s by no means a mainstream argument, or even one that I’ve like… ever heard. Like at least with the theybies thing I’ve like heard of it. He was incorrect to pretend it’s mainstream, but I’ve heard people say that before. In this case, I’ve literally never heard of anyone who thinks this in my entire life. Nobody thinks that half of the people in the world are trans, I have no idea where this idea came from. Obviously sex is related to gender, the argument is that they aren’t the same word and don’t have the exact same meaning. This is like if I told Bentoo Penguin that mass and weight aren’t the same thing, and then he went and made a video saying that “the left” thinks mass and weight are entirely separate and completely unrelated. Nobody thinks these things aren’t related, some people are just smart enough to know that they aren’t the exact same. They never have been, to clarify, obviously trans people haven’t always been as accepted as they are now, but the words have always had separate meanings. There’s a reason you’ve never heard of someone talking about the sexed isles in an apparel section of a supermarket, you don’t have sexed clothing, you have gendered clothing. And in the same way, you’ve probably never heard anyone say they gendered a dog, or that they had gender with your dad (okay lots of people have said this but nobody unironically uses it as a replacement for sex). But either way, gender having social connotations doesn’t mean it’s suddenly complete separate from sex, and I don’t know why he thinks it does. Ben would be right to say that this argument is hard to defend, because it is, that’s why nobody’s defending it. Kind of like how it’s hard to defend transphobia, which is why you so consistently lie and fail to provide any actual arguments in favor of your position. If anybody believed either of those two positions, I’d certainly agree that they’re quite foolish and misinformed. Thing is, only one of those positions is actually being argued for, and he’s the one defending it, not me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, kinda off-topic for just a minute, you know that’s not what a fallacy is, right? Like, there are two meanings to the word, so I’ll be charitable and assume he just means something that’s wrong, but if it’s so wrong it’s interesting that he so adamantly refuses to counter it. When he’s said wrong stuff, like about how asexual reproduction isn’t real, I was pretty easily able to say why he’s wrong and make it clear that he is, but for some reason, when there’s a blatant lie from “the left”, we simply have to hope that it’s a lie, and never look at any reasoning or data behind why it might be wrong. Okay sorry about that, just needed to rant a bit about that random statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he then says, correctly, might I add, that it’s undeniable that some aspects of femininity and masculinity are social, and that some are biological. As examples, he says that chopping wood and being stupid are considered masculine, but being loving and caring is considered feminine. So, he’s now admitting that his earlier arguments were wrong. Masculine just means man like, so if something is possible to be done by a woman, or not done by a man, that is considered masculine, then there’s clearly a level of arbitraity and “self-referentialism” to what these mean. So that argument has thrown itself out the window. Apparently, the scary black gender theorist wokes are arguing that if a man does something feminine, he must be trans, and that would obviously be a dumb position to hold, so clearly the Easter Benny must be right. Good thing there’s no group of people who are famously feminine and yet male at the same time that would prove this entire argument to be invalid. Right? I’ve never heard of a feminine boy, what would you even call that, a femboy? Clearly not a thing that exists in the world, the thought of that existing would be insane, obviously the wokes are making all the boys trans. Also like, once again a little off the subject, but like he knows there are trans femboys and trans tomboys, right? I’ve literally been friends with some, they’re not super common, that’s true, but they don’t just like not exist. So clearly the evil transes don’t think that femininity and masculinity are the only defining characteristics to whether you can be a man or a woman. He also earlier said that scientists think anyone can be a man or a woman, and there’s no standard applied, which contradicts this. I debunked that whole thing earlier, but even if I hadn’t, clearly one of the things he’s saying in this video is a lie, they logistically can’t both be true at the same time. I see this argument a lot from transphobes, most specifically I notice the tomboy argument a lot. In fact, it’s even in one of the top comments on this very video. They essentially just say “I was a tomboy growing up” which given the context they’re likely lying, but who knows. And then they say “but if I was raised in this time I would be FORCED to take hormones and be BRAINWASHED into thinking I’m trans.” And that’s like… the most indoctrinated thing I’ve ever heard. Like at this point, obviously they’ve given up on arguing, fear is their next best bet, so they try and say stuff like this. But like… if that’s the case, why is it that it literally never happens ever? Like my dude, tomboys exist, you know that tomboys exist, right? I’m friends with several, it’s not like an uncommon thing by any means, nor are they forced to be trans. There are also trans tomboys, this argument never works, but as long as no one who’s educated on the issue says anything, they can use it in their own circles as bait to scare people into hating trans people even more than they already do, thus continuing their oppression for longer, which is the main goal. But I digress, there’s a lot more to talk about in this video, so we probably shouldn’t stay on this for too long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Real quick, before we jump into the next section, I just wanted to mention. I find it odd, but he keeps showing images on screen of people holding up signs saying stuff about how science agrees with trans people and scientists know that gender is a social construct and so on and so on, but he never seems to refute this in any way. Like it’s just kinda weird, cuz he keeps showing them as if he’s gonna talk about it or whatever, but he never brings up if scientists actually agree with it, and I don’t know why. I mean his whole brand is about science being a scam, so I don’t really know why he doesn’t at least say that much, I guess he’s just kinda assuming if you’re watching his content you probably already agree with that. I mean I went to the comments of this video and that seems to ring true, most of them blatantly openly denounce science (except the ones critiquing the video). One guy seemed to pretend to like science, and said that the video was “biological facts”, so when I brought up that all biological facts disagree with them, they asked for a source. Obviously, I provided a few, though much less than I could’ve, and as soon as I did, they shut down and ignored it entirely, returning to the basic “science is leftie bullshit” and just said that there are only 2 genders, kinda just ignoring what the conversation was even about. Also, goes without saying, but they obviously ignored my response and all the sources in it. Not only did they not try to critique them, they just ignored them entirely.They asked for a source, in hopes that I would simply be too lazy to provide one, and when I provided several, they entirely shut down, unable to provide any semblance of a response to the data provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with every stupid transphobe, it’s John Money time. Woo, finally. Once again I’m gonna put the much larger quote so I can take him in context, and then break it up and discuss everything. “The origins of the gender identity movement lie with a professor of medical psychology at Johns Hopkins in the 1960’s. His name was John Money. After twin boys were born, and after a botched circumcision destroyed one boy’s penis, that boy was raised as a girl. By the time that boy was a teenager the boy felt extreme discomfort, because he was biologically male, and his parents told him the truth. Both twins ended up killing themselves in their thirties. That didn’t stop John Money from founding the John Hopkins Gender Identity Clinic in 1965.” Now wow, that’s a lot of ignorant shit spouted all at once, here we go again I guess. Okay, so right from the start he’s being dishonest, not even gonna mention “the gender identity movement” bit cuz I feel like that’s just mean and doesn’t really get to the heart of the argument. So first off, no, “transgenderism” didn’t start in the 60’s, what he actually meant is that the word gender was coined by John Money, it didn’t just not exist until then. If you think gender itself didn’t exist till then, then you’re either saying that sex didn’t exist till then (in which case why should we care), or you’re admitting that gender is social, because if it supposedly didn’t exist until John Money first used the word, and if sex did exist before then (which it did \\[8\\]), then clearly gender has to be socially constructed. Now, this is still wrong, gender is a social construct, that much is true, but it wasn’t invented when John Money first used the word. Now yes, at a literal level, gender was invented by John Money, if you’re referring to the word itself, but the concept it refers to has existed much much longer. The “gender identity movement” definitely didn’t start with John Money, and by no means is he the face of the movement Shapiri Bendrix wishes he was. If “transgenderism” and “the gays” never existed before then, how did the Nazis oppress trans and other LGBT+ people and burn research about them? How were there trans people in the times of Ancient Greece? (To clarify, because I know someone would try to use this as a point against me if I didn’t (if anyone was actually reading this), no, I don’t support everything done in Ancient Greece, in fact I denounce most of it, it was a shitty place and they did terrible things, the only point is that trans people didn’t suddenly come out of thin air in the 60s). How did so many places end up having three genders if supposedly it didn’t even exist until the 1960s? In reality, Benis Shapenis is already well aware of the fact that transgender people have existed for a long time, but it helps his narrative to pretend he’s ignorant for two main reasons. Firstly, if trans people are a new thing, not just an old thing that’s becoming more accepted, then it can easily be excused as liberal decadence, even if that position is still ignorant, it’s easy to swallow. Secondly, by pretending John Money is the origin of transgender people, he can pretend that trans people must all be bad, since John Money did bad things. Now, for someone whose main position in this argument is the same one held by the Nazis, this seems like a bad thing to believe. (To clarify, before you get mad, no, I don’t think Ben Shapiro is a Nazi, I’m pointing out the invalidity of his argument).\n",
      "\n",
      "The next statements are mostly pretty true, but I find it interesting that he somehow thinks these are arguments for his biases, not for science. Most of what he says next is in fact correct. Yes, John Money did participate in having a child born male raised as female. Yes, being raised as the gender he didn’t identify with did cause him extreme discomfort. So in conclusion, it would be accurate to say that raising children or even referring to people as a gender they don’t identify with can cause extreme discomfort and even suicide, and nobody should do it or else they’re evil. And this is the part where you start to question “wait why is this in an anti-trans propaganda video.” Like yeah, no shit if you call someone the wrong gender for years and years and convince them they’re a gender they don’t identify with they’re gonna be harmed by it, THAT’S THE WHOLE POINT TRANS ACTIVISTS ARE MAKING. He tells this like some sort of fear story, as if it makes trans people seem spooky, but in reality all he’s doing is pointing out the evils of misgendering people, which I quite agree with about being bad. How on earth is this even supposed to be interpreted as an anti-trans argument? All he said was misgendering people and disrespecting their gender identity can cause dysphoria, and then somehow acted like that was a point for HIS argument? He does say some questionable things however. He acts as if the suicide was a direct result of the gender dysphoria that David felt (David Reimer is the child being referred to, if you’re wondering), but the suicide was much after he started living life as male. He also got a double mastectomy, as well as bottom surgery to get a full penis, but these are things normally Ben would adamantly oppose, it’s interesting how that works, it’s almost as if his problem isn’t actually kids getting surgery or anything, but just that trans kids exist and he doesn’t like them, hmm. More importantly though, I find it interesting how he phrases things. “Both twins committed suicide, but that didn’t stop John Money from founding the Johns Hopkins gender identity clinic.” He says that as if that happened after they committed suicide, but it was far far earlier. David killed himself in 2004, and his twin brother died two years earlier, so to pretend that the founding of the Johns Hopkins gender identity clinic (founded in 1965 as Ben himself stated) should have been effected by that suicide is fallacious and intellectually dishonest at best. Of course, it fits the narrative better to pretend John Money was just fine with the suicide, because the entire argument is based around him being a bad person, which to clarify, he was, but it’s still an incredibly dumb argument. It’s essentially a less explicit version of a hasty generalization fallacy. For anyone who doesn’t know what that is, it’s essentially when you generalize someone hastily, specifically, it refers to when you take one group or person and take a thing that group or person did, and then take a person and say because they did one thing that the group or person did, they must be the same. That sentence is impossible to read, so I’ll just give you the most common example used for it, which you’ve probably heard before. A hasty generalization fallacy is when you say “Nazis drank water, you drink water, so you must be a Nazi.” This is a more subtle version of the same fallacy, the argument being made clearly has nothing to do with the actual events that took place, else his argument would be pro-trans. The argument is that John Money did bad things, and John Money liked trans people, so everyone who likes trans people is just as bad as him. To be more specific, this is a genetic fallacy, and a wrong one at that. A genetic fallacy is the idea that based on the origin of something that thing is wrong, but in this case that fallacy doesn’t even apply, as John Money clearly isn’t the origin of women, trans people, or whatever else Karen Bendou thinks he made. You’ve probably heard John Money brought up before, transphobes love to use him to make this same argument. It’s honestly kind of disappointing when you think about it, the fact that they have to go to John Money to make an argument that makes trans people sound bad is kinda telling about them. It’s also a weird point to use, when so many arguments made by the same people can be directly associated with Hitler. In reality, bad people can do good things, even if they as people aren’t good. Ben makes a point of never addressing anything Money said directly. He brings up right after that Money thought that gender identity was separate from sex, but he never addressed that point or why it’s wrong, the only thing he addressed was that John Money had those beliefs, and that he also did morally detestable things. The fact that someone is even bringing up John Money is already a point against them the way I see things. If you have to make personalized arguments against a person who believed the same thing as someone you’re arguing with, rather than being able to argue against the thing itself, that shows that you don’t have an argument. And whilst not having an argument for everything doesn’t necessarily make your position wrong, the fact that he can’t come up with one in this whole video that was likely well thought out, and that above that there are hundreds of thousands of people watching this and thinking he’s smart, is definitely something of note. The entire John Money argument never works and never has worked, and the fact that so many people tend to bring it up when it goes directly against their own arguments goes to show the kind of people we’re dealing with. The kind of people that don’t really care if they’re wrong or whether or not science agrees with them, as long as they can feel superior, or bully a kid into killing themself, and then make a snarky joke about that kid’s death, it doesn’t really matter to them whether or not what they’re saying makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now he brings up a few things. He says that “radical feminists like Judith Butler argue that all gender is socially constructed,” (which it is). And that “if gender is just some meaningless social construct, why would it matter more than sex, which is actual real biology, and why would gender be more real than biology itself? And if they’re completely unrelated, why do so many trans people get sexual reassignment surgery?” Now, I hate to keep reiterating this point, but unfortunately I have to. This isn’t something we can just gloss over, and he keeps lying, so I must keep reiterating. PEOPLE ARE NOT ADVOCATING FOR THE IDEA THAT GENDER AND SEX ARE COMPLETELY UNRELATED AT ANY LEVEL. He keeps saying that scientists think that gender and sex are completely unrelated, and he keeps being wrong about it. Now, obviously, I can’t speak for all scientists, but by absolutely no means is this a commonly accepted truth in the world of science, if you said this to a scientist, a leftist, or just any person that doesn’t hate trans people (because despite what you might think, there is such thing as right-wingers that don’t hate minorities), they would pretty quickly dismiss you as an idiot and say that you’re misinterpreting things. His next point is that if gender is a social construct, and thus meaningless, then why should people care about it so much, and more than sex? Now this is making a lot of bold, and mostly wrong, assumptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "He takes for granted that if gender is a social construct, then it must be completely meaningless, and that’s like super ignorant. Something being social doesn’t make it automatically meaningless, the fact that he can even think this is astonishingly incorrect. Somehow in Karben Shapendou’s head, social and meaningless are synonymous, and that’s very wrong. It makes sense for him, he’s the one who popularized the phrase “facts don’t care about your feelings”, which inevitably was taken by the left almost immediately, as it’s much more useful to things we say, since we’re the ones who present facts. But this assumption that social and meaningless are somehow the exact same word is about as smart as thinking that sex and gender are the exact same… because it’s like… really dumb and wrong. If you think about this position for even a second, it instantly becomes ridiculous. There’s no way a rational person could defend this line of thinking. For example earlier when I talked about chairs and how they’re social, that doesn’t mean that chairs are meaningless and we shouldn’t care about the word chair, I never said that, in fact I like the word chair, and I say it a lot, the fact that the word has social connotations in no way makes me think the word is less useful. For a better example, how about money? It’s undeniable (for a mentally developed person who’s also aware of what money is) that money is a social construct, of course it is. I don’t think I really need to explain this but just in case I’ll briefly go over it anyway. Money doesn’t have objective value, at least not outside of the value of the object used to represent it. A lot of money today is digital, but like think about it, if you go back in time to the 1860s and say hey I’ll give you this prepaid debit card that has five hundred dollars on it in return for ten meals at this restaurant, they’re likely not gonna take you up. Even though the value of five hundred dollars is well over what it costs for ten meals at a normal restaurant, the card doesn’t have that value to them, the only value you could convince someone of in it is the value of the card itself, it wouldn’t be worth anything monetarily. Money is determined to be valuable by humans, but it isn’t in and of itself worth anything, money is only valuable because we say it is, it’s as socially constructed as things get. I couldn’t just make my own crypto-currency or whatever else tomorrow and then buy lunch with it, but some currencies do become valuable, that’s a product of people valuing them, not of some biological reality. Despite this, I for some reason doubt that CarBen Dioxide thinks money is “meaningless”. Now, there’s a chance he meant in a more broad sense, and he’s just arguing for gender abolitionism. Maybe he’s just saying “but if you think it’s a social construct, why don’t you advocate for abolishing it?” And as a gender abolitionist, I do think that, but even if I didn’t, that’s a pretty shitty argument for gender abolitionism. And even as a gender abolitionist, that doesn’t mean I can’t acknowledge gender as real and meaningful. In the same way, I think that (eventually, definitely not right now), society would benefit from removal of money, and maybe he thinks the same thing, but that absolutely doesn’t mean that we can’t accept that money has value in our society. He’s literally talked about it before, he’s brought up how the rich are too highly taxed, and argued that money shouldn’t be given to people in need because it would help them. But if money was meaningless it clearly couldn’t help them, so there’d be no reason to oppose it from his standpoint. In the same way, even as a gender abolitionist (which lots of people who are smart enough to understand that gender is social aren’t), I still have to understand that gender doesn’t just not matter, or is completely meaningless. I still say the word gender, I still use gendered pronouns even though I dislike the fact that they exist, not liking gendered language doesn’t mean I don’t think it’s real. It’s an undeniable fact that misgendering a trans person will cause them harm, so CLEARLY trans people don’t just think gender is meaningless, that shows that it pretty self-evidently has meaning to them.The problem is that Benathan Shapirstar injects his own ways of thinking into everything. He believes that if he thinks something, everyone must think the same way. Leftists don’t disagree with him, they actually view the world the exact same as him, but simply have an inverted sense of right and wrong. Because of that he assumes that if you don’t like something you have to pretend it doesn’t exist, because that’s what he does. But I can dislike gender as a concept and still understand that it’s real and the functions it serves. And even then, not everyone is a gender abolitionist, and that doesn’t really work as an argument for it either, nor does it work as an argument against those people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next on the assumptions, he takes for granted the idea that in contrast to gender, since sex is rooted in biologically empirical facts, it must be more relevant. Now, sex is obviously also a social construct, but he’s correct to assume that as a social construct, sex is much more based in something empirically measurable than gender. That doesn’t make it matter though, in the same way that being social doesn’t make something not matter. The same way that there are thousands of things that are social that we think still matters, there are also thousands of things that are biological that we don’t think bears a bunch of weight solely by its merits of being empirically measurable. He acts like the fact that sex is biological, in and of itself, makes it somehow important in every context. What about how many hairs someone has on their body? That’s a biological fact, so why don’t we refer to people in groups based on how many hairs they have? And people are still classified by their sex when it’s useful, by the way. If it’s required to know if someone is capable of giving birth (which lots of cis women aren’t), scientists will still be willing to say if someone can or not, and would likely even say that most XY people can’t. What about blood type? We still use it often, it’s not like it isn’t important, it’s used in medicine all the time. And we also can objectively determine what someone’s blood type is, it’s a biological fact. So then why don’t we call everyone by groups associated with their blood type? Being biological doesn’t make something meaningful, and even when it is, that doesn’t mean we have to refer to people based on those labels when it isn’t useful to do so. Most people probably don’t actually have verifiable proof of their chromosomes all the time, I can make a pretty good guess about what chromosomes I have, but I’ve never actually gotten it tested, I have no clue. So why would referring to people by chromosomes that you don’t even know if they actually have make any more sense than referring to them by their gender, which both has more social utility and is easier to determine? It’s also of note that he acts as if by saying gender is important, or even just that it’s more important than sex, that means that you’re saying it’s more important than “biology itself.” That’s pretty dumb, nobody is claiming that sex isn’t real, or that biology doesn’t matter. I don’t know why so many transphobes act as if the “woke SJW blue haired lesbians” think sex isn’t real, and act like it’s some kind of “gotcha”. I know sex is real, I have it with lots of people’s dads. But seriously, people aren’t saying that sex isn’t real, we’re saying that someone’s gender identity doesn’t always coincide with their assigned sex, and that that doesn’t make their gender invalid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next he asks why if gender and sex are completely unrelated, trans people still get sexual reassignment surgeries to help with their dysphoria. Yet again, I must reiterate, that despite the whole fifteen seconds between now and the last time he said this, it still hasn’t become true that people think this. BUT, despite the fact that this strawman he keeps making is so obviously stupid, the point still doesn’t even hold. Even if gender and sex were unrelated, him and people like him clearly don’t seem to agree, he seems to think they’re synonymous, so given that, people could be getting surgeries to help alleviate gender dysphoria caused from transphobes, or maybe to get transphobic people to accept them easier. Transphobes clearly have a harder time misgendering people that have gone through procedures like that (I mean usually they don’t see their genitals, but like HRT and stuff for sure). Lots of people assume trans people are cis, even transphobic ones, it’s not uncommon for a trans person to pass as cis, and whilst it doesn’t make their identity any more valid, it obviously makes their life a lot easier, even if the strawman was actually the case. Take a look at Steven Crowder talking about trans people, he’s clearly transphobic, or at least pretends to be, and he intentionally misgenders people all the time. But look at him actually doing it, with post-op trans men who have transitioned to the point of passing, like when he talked about Elliot Page, he clearly had to go out of his way to misgender him, it wasn’t some slip of the tongue or anything, he even sometimes accidentally gendered him correctly. So even if trans rights activists DID think that gender and sex were completely unrelated on any level, which they still don’t, there would still be obvious reasons why people get surgeries and hormones for sexual transition. And apart from transmedicalists, who are dumb and wrong, you probably won’t see many people saying that surgery makes trans people more valid. I’ve had lots of trans supportive woke friends, I’ve had lots of trans friends as well, and nobody seems to believe in this idea that medical transition actually makes people more valid, so your argument doesn’t even make sense in terms of your own false hypothetical. Bendocrinology manages to constantly strawman every single point he’s arguing against, consistently using it as his main method of argument, and then still somehow proceeds to lose the arguments with the strawmen he created. It’s kind of astonishing. It makes you question if he actually believes that this is what people think, because what’s the point in making a strawman if you can’t argue against it. You would think if you were gonna lie about your political opposition and the arguments they make, you’d at least do it in a way that you can destroy them. And don’t get me wrong, the strawman arguments he’s creating are absolutely stupid, and people believing them would make those people wrong, but it’s still weird that he chose things he himself couldn’t argue against.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next of course, the classic “trans people exist, they're just not normal” argument. He states that “gender dysphoria is a serious and tragic disorder, it’s also extremely rare.” Which is already wrong, gender dysphoria isn’t a disorder, it’s a feeling. Also some cis people have dysphoria, this argument already doesn’t make any sense. He then goes on to cite that according to the DSM-5, those who had received a medical diagnosis of gender identity disorder or transsexualism and were seeking hormone treatment and/or surgery represented only 0.014% for those assigned male at birth. Now unfortunately, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition is over a hundred dollars, so I won’t be able to perfectly review it. What I can say with confidence however, is that it’s been revised in its language surrounding gender dysphoria, and so it’s a little suspicious that Ben chose to use the wrong terminology, because the book now uses different terminology than what he said. I also find it interesting that for a book he knew lots of people wouldn’t have access to, he deliberately chose to avoid quoting the full context of what it said, it’s almost like he’s hiding something. But even if he was being fully honest, and just kinda forgot that part and also only misquoted accidentally, it still doesn’t prove anything. Next thing I know he’s gonna tell me that there are more left-handed people in society today than in 1910. No shit less people were open about being trans a long time ago, interracial relationships are more common now too, deal with it, that’s how progress works. And even then, he’s not talking about trans people, just people as specified by what he said, which certainly isn’t everyone who has dysphoria. Which, if you were wondering, still isn’t a disorder. He then says that the “non-politicized” definition of gender dysphoria is the “persistent belief that you’re a member of the opposite sex”. That’s not true, if that wasn’t obvious, if you ask someone who maybe Googled it once and waited to find an answer with their own biases it might say that, but even then that by definition is the politicized version of it, so doesn’t work. According to the UK’s National Health Service, which as of recently has clearly been effected by politics (see the Cass report), gender dysphoria is defined as “a term that describes a sense of unease that a person may have because of a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity. This sense of unease or dissatisfaction may be so intense it can lead to depression and anxiety and have a harmful impact on daily life.” The Mayo Clinic defines gender dysphoria as “the feeling of discomfort or distress that might occur in people whose gender identity differs from their sex assigned at birth or sex-related physical characteristics.” Or how about the DSM-5? That’s the source he just used, so I’m sure he won’t mind using their definition. The DSM-5 defines gender dysphoria as “an incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender and their assigned gender, causing discomfort that lasts six months or more”, with extra requirements for a medical diagnosis \\[9\\]. Weird how the literal source he gave less than five sentences ago disagrees with him. Supposedly science nowadays is politicized, but not thirty seconds ago he himself used a source that he’s now claiming is itself politicized. So then clearly he’s biased, if supposedly not only is his own source politicized according to his own words, but also the fact that he chooses to quote parts of it out of context, but completely ignores what it actually says.\n",

      "\n",
      "It’s easy to slip into the information overload phase and thinking, “oh I could do this and that with this topic! I could learn everything about it in TWO weeks, and teach it to someone else! I could become the best.” \n",
